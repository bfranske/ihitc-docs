= Inver Hills ITC Department Information Site
This site is designed to eventually replace the https://wiki.ihitc.net[ITC Wiki].

It is built using Antora with the Lunr search engine and uses the AsciiDoc format for documentation.

The built site is available at https://bfranske.github.io/ihitc-docs/
