Hills Community College will grant credit equivalencies to many Information Technology & Careers (ITC, CS) courses based on certification exam results indicating a passing score which meet the following criteria: . Exam is administered by Pearson VUE, Thomson/Prometric, Certiport or a future authorized industry certification testing company. Certification results are confirmed directly from certifying agent (e.g., Cisco, Microsoft, CompTIA) through mail, secure website or other means initiated by the certifying agent. The student is responsible for making arrangements to provide this documentation. . The certification exam is based on outcomes and objectives that correspond substantially to the content being taught in current courses. In cases where the current course content is based on technology that is substantially different from the certification exam taken by the student, credit will not be granted. Students my retake exams to qualify for credit equivalency. . In the case of certifications with expiration dates the certification is not expired. In the case of individual exams or certifications without expiration dates the exam taken is the most current version. Due to constantly evolving industry certifications specific exams are no longer listed in the course catalog with course equivalencies. A faculty member from the ITC department will review all credit equivalencies for ITC courses and determine whether the exam taken or certification obtained substantially corresponds to the course. A general guideline of common course equivalencies can be found on the ITC department website or by contacting one of the ITC instructors. Examples of certifications commonly accepted for course credit include the CompTIA A+, Cisco CCNA, CCNA Specializations, CCNP, Microsoft MCITP and Microsoft Office Specialist tracks. The table below is a general guideline of common course equivalencies and does not assure the academic credit will be granted for specific exams. Exams vary in content and structure over time and may not measure the current outcomes and objectives of a course; in such cases, credit cannot be given for current courses.

Note the tabs at the bottom of the document for different degree programs. In determining the course sequence (and the schedule for our classes) we need to make some assumptions. It’s OK if you don’t match these assumptions but it will likely mean that you will need more than 4 semesters (2 years) to complete your degree. This depends on your specific situation. In any case we do not recommend taking any class before you have completed all of the prerequisites for the class. IT courses build on one another so you should finish any required prerequisite course listed before taking a class. We assume you start in the Fall semester. We do have some class options if you start in the Spring but you will likely have to wait for some classes too because we just don’t have enough students starting in the Spring to run a second copy of every course and, as noted above, IT courses tend to build on one another. If you start in the Spring it’s most likely that you will have some lighter semesters (fewer credits) but will probably take an extra semester to graduate. We assume you are a full-time student. This means you will be taking between 14-16 credits a semester. This is some pretty simple math, to do a 60 credit degree program (as most 2 year degrees are) you need to do an average of 60/4 = 15 credits per semester. Because there is a 4 credit writing class one semester will need to be 16 credits. If you are a full-time student we recommend you do not plan on working more than a few hours a week. Our courses cover a lot of material and we expect that if you are taking 15 credits of classes you are spending about 45 hours a week on classes/homework. That doesn’t leave a lot of time for outside employment. Many of our students do work while taking classes but if you are working an appreciable number of hours you should probably plan on being a part-time student and taking fewer classes per semester. These course sequences don’t show you exactly which classes to take when in that case, but can provide some useful suggestions about the general order you should take classes in and what semesters certain classes are offered. We assume you do not need to re-take any classes. Depending on what class it is this could throw you off the track of pre-requisites and that would mean one or two additional semesters before you can get the class you need to continue on your track so graduation will take one or two semesters longer. We assume you do not need to take remedial classes. If you are not yet ready for any of the classes on the sequence (e.g. you have not placed in to ENG 1108, or haven’t tested out of ITC-1200 and want to do the Network Technology & Security degree) that would be additional time beyond the sequence of classes we have laid out as those classes are not really part of the degree itself.

You can see that both the most important and most interesting parts of the chapter were clearly discusses as well as what the author thinks is the reason they are interesting and important. Questions related to the content of the chapter have been included making it easier for other students to respond to the posting. Most Important: It seemed like the most important topic covered by this chapter was an overview of security threats in section 1.2 (i.e. threat vectors, virus/trojan/worm/malware, hackers), the types of hackers (black/grey/white hat, hacktivists, state-sponsored), the types of tools they employ (password crackers, packet sniffers/crafters, rootkits to name a few), and the categories of attacks (eavesdropping, spoofing, DoS, man-in-the-middle, reconnaissance, etc) to give us an idea of how important security is in today’s networks and ways to potentially mitigate against those threats (as covered in section 1.3). Most Interesting: One interesting part of the chapter to me was the discussion of 'honeypot' servers and how Norse Dark Intelligence purposefully deploys these decoy servers and study how hackers attempt to breach their security. Afterward, they provide the information to organizations for examination allowing them to come up with countermeasures against it. Similarly, Cisco provides information and mitigation techniques against current attacks on their Cisco Security Intelligence Operations (SIO) site for network administrators. Another interesting part of the chapter to me was just how secure Data Center Networks are. Because of the amounts of sensitive business data they house, they are not only securely interconnected to corporate sites (e.g. via VPN/ASA devices) but also require many levels of physical security; Some examples include security officers, fences/gates, video surveillance, alarms, motion detectors, traps, and bio-metric access/exit (such as a badge ID to enter the trap and then facial/fingerprint recognition to enter and exit the data hall). Questions: How do they make a 'honeypot' server an attractive enough target for hackers? Do they leave certain vulnerabilities open on purpose, make them conspicuous enough, or are networks so routinely under attack that none of these measures are necessary? Also, when a virtual machine hosted on cloud computing that has outdated security (hasn’t been powered on in a long time for example) connects to the internet, would that be considered a threat vector to the rest of the network (like hyperjacking) or is the sand-boxed nature of virtual machines enough of a preventive measure? This post comes from an early chapter in the PC Hardware & Software class. It clearly describes what the author thought the most important and interesting parts of the chapter where and why as well as a couple of questions related to the content of the chapter. I personally thought the most important concept from chapter one was the compatibility of components. For example processors manufactured by AMD have a physically different design to those manufactured by Intel. So, If a technician is building a computer, they must select a CPU that is compatible with the motherboard they have chosen. This is important because incompatibility can cause a computer to fail, even if all the components are operational. I thought the most interesting section of the chapter was the one about the differing ports and cables. Before this reading I was only familiar with the most common types of ports/cables like DVI, HDMI, USB, etc. I had heard the name of some of the other types of ports/cables, but I did not know what they were used for or how they compared to each other. I now understand each type of port/cable, and its function. I was wondering generally how long it took for new technologies to be adopted by the public. Also, why has USB persisted if thunderbolt has been so much faster for much longer?

You will be graded based on your participation in the online discussion and the quality of your posts and interaction with others online. As with many classes there is typically a three-post minimum for each chapter to be considered as participating. In all cases though you are better served by posting more and quality is just as important as quantity. In fact, you can get full points even with less than three posts if your posts are extremely high quality, substantially contribute to the discussion, and aid in assisting other members of the course understand the material. While only 3 posts are generally required, if you are more active in the forum than that and helping people you can earn additional points (up to the maximum for each topic) for additional response posts so if you forget the initial post or some of your posts are not quite high enough quality to earn all the points typically given for that post type you could still potentially earn all of the points by being active and helpful with more posts. When grading posts the biggest factor in getting a good score is how much new and unique information you have contributed to the discussion. This is why simply agreeing with someone else about what they thought was important or interesting will likely not earn you any points for that post no matter how long of a post it is. This means you can write an entire page of text but if it basically summarizes to \"I agree with you\" or \"I found what you posted helpful\" it’s not worth anything. Normally though a longer, more detailed, post will get a higher score than a shorter post. Also, inclusion of helpful outside materials (links to relevant articles, YouTube videos, etc.) is helpful in raising the score on your post though it should be clear you didn’t just do a search and added some links you should have read and reviewed the video/links and speak as to the specific content or way each might be helpful. Be sure to talk about and integrate the outside information into your post though and not just spam a bunch of links, that wouldn’t really be contributing any of your own thoughts and doesn’t show you have read the article or given much thought to it. Under no circumstances can forum posts be turned in late (after the response posts are due for a chapter). Because forum postings require a back-and-forth between multiple members of the class it is simply not possible to accept these late under any circumstances. You can always still try to get all the points even if you miss the first post by being exceptionally active and high quality in your response posts (making many more than the minimum and high in quality) but after the due date for the response posts there is no guarantee you will be able to make these up in any way. See below for some specific details about how each type of post should be handled. I do not generally grade on grammar but if your poor grammar makes it difficult or impossible to understand what you are trying to say or you break other rules below you can absolutely receive a zero on a post (or even many posts). The first post you make for each chapter is typically the longest and most detailed. It should include a brief discussion of what you thought the most important parts of the chapter were and why they are important for you to know, what you thought the most interesting parts were and why you found them interesting, and at least one question related either directly to the readings or the general topic covered in the readings. If forum posts for each chapter/topic in the course are worth a total of 10 points (this varies a bit from class to class) you can usually earn up to 5 points for this initial post. DO: Separate your post into at least three paragraphs/headings: \"Most Important\", \"Most Interesting\", and \"Questions\" Pick one specific thing from the chapter that was the most interesting to you and talk about why it is so interesting to you. Use at the very minimum three sentences to explain this. It’s pretty easy to get to five sentences if you’re doing a good job explaining why you think this the most interesting thing. Pick one specific thing from the chapter that you think was the most important and talk about why you think it is so important for you to know. Use at the very minimum three sentences to explain this. It’s pretty easy to get to five sentences if you’re doing a good job explaining why you think this the most important thing. End with one or two questions about something related to the chapter. They could be something you didn’t quite understand from the chapter or they could be something related to a topic from the chapter but not specifically covered. Ensure your question(s) are clear to others and if someone responds back to you about them you should give them some feedback about their answer, ask for more clarification, etc. Make sure that your post is clearly and thoroughly communicating the ideas you want to share following general English grammar and writing rules. Use complete sentences to express your thoughts. Relate the topic to yourself. Think about things you may need to do in the future and what would be important or interesting to know and why it would be important for you to know or interesting to you. DO NOT: Summarize the entire chapter/module/topic Say that everything was important or just repeat the name of the chapter/module/topic as important Say that everything was interesting or just repeat the name of the chapter/module/topic as interesting Post something which is not easily understood by another person (related to the grammar of the post) Forget to explain why you found things important to know or interesting to you. Think about things you may need to do in the future and what would be important or interesting to know. Use any kind of automatic summarization tools or have anyone else summarize for you. (see the academic integrity section of the syllabus) Turn in someone else’s work (see the academic integrity section of the syllabus) Skip writing 1-2 questions for other people to respond to because you \"understood everything\". It’s great if you understood everything but then you should have questions about the topic which were not covered in the readings that you are wondering about. After you make your initial post you should continue to contribute to the forum by regularly reading the postings of other class members and responding as appropriate. Particularly, try to assist in answering their questions, pointing them to additional related resources you found helpful including YouTube videos, other sites, locations in the readings, etc. These posts should be much more than just agreeing with what someone else stated or saying that you found their post helpful. You need to substantially contribute and add new information to an ongoing discussion about the topic in order to be considered as participating. Simple agreement posts will not be worth any points. If forum posts for each chapter/topic in the course are worth a total of 10 points (this varies a bit from class to class) you can usually earn up to 2-3 points for each response post. DO: Try to answer questions that people have posed Try to do some research on people’s questions instead of just providing an opinion without any support Include links to outside resources such as reputable websites, videos, etc. Try to be helpful or ask for help if you are having a problem with a related lab activity or anything else related to the topic. Post more times than the minimum required if you want to be sure to get all the points. Respond thoroughly and clearly. To clearly communicate an idea in less than 3-5 sentences is very difficult in most cases. Use complete sentences to express your thoughts. DO NOT: Post links without any of your own description/details/how you found them helpful. You need to review the material you’re linking to and talk about it in your response post too. Just agree with other people or provide posts with minimal useful contribution to the discussion Expect points just for posting, you need to follow the rules and be really contributing to helping other people in order to get points Be too brief with your post to be useful Sample First Posts Sample Response Posts Document Build Time: 2022-09-28 20:28:03 -0500 Page Version: 2022.08 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License","title":"Franske Forum Posting Format","component":"franske-courses","version":"2022.08","name":"index","url":"/franske-courses/current/forum-posting/","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"First Post","hash":"_first_post","id":2},{"text":"Response Posts","hash":"_response_posts","id":3},{"text":"Sample Forum Posts","hash":"_sample_forum_posts","id":4}]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"For each module having lab activities you will need to submit one lab report which covers all of the lab activities listed below in the module. Submissions are made through the NetAcad site. Lab activities may include remote equipment access or campus equipment. Good lab reports in this class are typically 400-700 words long. If you work with a partner on a lab you only need to submit a single lab report for the two of you but it must have both your names on it. Each lab report is worth up to 20 points. If you have not done lab reports in one of Dr. Franske’s classes before, or you want to try and score better on lab reports, be sure to check out the instructions for writing lab reports page and example reports!

Complete DevNet Developer Workstation and Environment Setup Lab In this lab activity you will, amongst other things download and install the OpenConnect VPN client which is used to connect to the DevNet sandbox labs. Unfortunately there is a bug in this software which prevents OpenVPN (which you may use for connecting to ITCnet in other classes) from resetting Windows DNS server addresses. This will prevent you from accessing ITCnet resources, even after disconnecting from the DevNet sandbox VPN in OpenConnect. To fix this after EACH time you use OpenConnect to access DevNet sandboxes after disconnecting you will need to open your network adapter properties for the \"TAP-Windows Adapter\" and open the IPv4 settings. You will see that OpenConnect has left DNS set as \"Use the following DNS server addresses\" with two addresses filled in. Change the setting back to \"Obtain DNS server address automatically\" and save the settings. The next time you connect to OpenVPN you should have access to the ITCnet DNS server and resources again. Complete the Programming Fundamentals Module from the DevNet Beginner track In Step 2 of the \"A Brief Introduction to Git\" lab you are told you should have already downloaded a Git repository or you should follow the link at the top with instructions for setting up your workstation. Follow that link and see the section titled Using Git to Copy Code and Setting Up the Local Environment. You should clone and use the Data Center Infrastructure: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/dciv2-code repository. Complete the REST API Fundamentals Module from the DevNet Beginner track Complete the Network Programmability Module from the DevNet Beginner track On page 2 of the \"Cisco DNA Center Platform - Authentication\" lab and in some future labs you may receive an error about SSL certificates when running code. Because the Cisco DNAC has a self-signed certificate you will need to change Python Requests function calls from things like: requests.post(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(DNAC_USER, DNAC_PASSWORD)) to things like requests.post(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(DNAC_USER, DNAC_PASSWORD), verify=False) by setting the verify flag to false you can tell the Python requests library to ignore SSL certificate verification. In the \"End to End Visibility and Assurance with Path Trace and Cisco DNA Center Platform\" lab you should re-check the \"How To Setup Your Own Computer\" link at the top of the page. There is a new GitHub repo to clone which contains the path_trace.py file. Also, we don’t expect you to be able to write the entire path_trace.py program by yourself at this point. Instead, you should reference that file while reading through the lab’s explanation of some of the functions so you can see (and hopefully understand) how the program works and what sorts of information are being pulled from the API when you execute the program. You can also try using Postman to make the same API requests and get the same data that you’re getting though Python. If you want to see what the GUI interface for Cisco DNA Center looks like you can go to https://sandboxdnac2.cisco.com and sign in with the username devnet and password Cisco123! Complete all modules in the IOS XE Programmability track The SSH instructions in the \"Exploring IOS XE YANG Data Models with NETCONF\" lab are designed for use on an *NIX based system so they will work best with a Linux computer/VM, a Mac, or in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Complete all modules in the Introduction to Ansible track Complete the \"Introduction to Configuration Management\" and \"Introduction to Ansible\" modules in the Introduction to Ansible for IOS XE Configuration Management track Complete the \"Managing IoT Harware with Ansible\" module. Homework activities will require submitting the actual answers to each question in the activity and may require showing your work as well. Homework assignment are individual, you and your lab partner need to both turn them in separately even if you work on them together. Participate in an online forum discussion (typically 3 quality posts or more) of each module on the Cisco Netacad site. See the forum posting page for details. (up to 10 points each module based on quality) Discussion forum posts are usually worth a larger portion of your final grade than most students expect! If you have not done discussion posts in one of Dr. Franske’s classes before, or you want to try and score better on discussion forum postings, be sure to check out the instructions for participating in forum discussions and example posts! Any participation activities completed in the course will go here. This falls into the participation category of your course grade. For each topic you need to meet with the instructor at least once to check on your status and understanding of the topic. Each meeting will be worth up to 10 points. You will need to complete peer evaluations of all course projects, these evaluations will be worth 10 participation points total. You are responsible for completing an online assessment for each topic. These fall into the topic assessments category of your course grade. You are responsible for completing a final exam, this will go into the regular final exam category of your course grade. The course project will take the place of the final skills exam in this course and will allow you and your lab partner to continue to experiment with one of the topic areas covered in the course. You will need to present your project in a presentation/demonstration to the class which is expected to last 10 minutes and you will need to write and submit project report. The project should be related to one of the three main units covered in the course. You may either expand on one of the tools that we used in the course or explore a different tool in the same topic area. Your project plan should be approved by the instructor. Remember that the project is 15% of your final grade so it is expected to be a substantial amount of work. Presentations should be very close to 10 minutes in length. While there is not a part of your score that is directly tied to timing if they are much longer or shorter you probably have either over-covered or under-covered what you did (or didn’t do enough work) which will definitely show up in your score. I suggest spending about half the time giving some background on your project (why you chose it, what are the key things you learned, what all did you do). You can have slides for this if you’d like. If you use slides I normally suggest no more than one slide per minute of presentation time (excluding a title slide) so probably stick to only about 5 slides of content. Also, follow good presentation tips for using slides (don’t make them overly complicated, don’t try to put too much information on one slide, don’t read your slides to us as part of your presentation, etc.) There are lots of good resources online that talk about creating effective presentation slides. Two examples are: https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/powerpoint-tips/simple-rules-for-better-powerpoint-presentations/1/ and https://www.unl.edu/gradstudies/connections/tips-creative-effective-powerpoint-presentations I suggest spending the other half of the time giving a demonstration about some part of your project. Don’t try to show off everything you did, cramming 3 weeks of work into 5 minutes is not possible. Pick one specific part of your project that you can demonstrate in 5 minutes and show that. You’re not trying to give a \"how-to\" presentation so you don’t need to show every step. Just give people an idea of what you did in your project. Stage things ahead of time and skip steps as needed to keep on time. The format is the same as a regular lab report (what you did, problems you had, how you tested, and what you learned) but the report must be much longer (about 4 pages single spaced) because it includes 3 weeks of work. It should be clear how you spent the three weeks and that it really was the equivalent amount of work as three weeks of regular classwork. You should thoroughly describe what you did (not exact steps, but an overview of the major things you accomplished), and what new things you learned by doing the project. It should be clear how the project relates to one of the topics from class. This should also be written like a paper explaining your project so don’t include a bunch of lists, etc. which are just there to fill space as that will not produce a quality report. There will be two primary components to your grade for the project, a lab report and a presentation. You will be turning in a lab report using the same format you have used for other lab reports in the class but it will be longer as this is a much more substantial project. Lab reports for this project should be about 4 pages long (single spaced) and include all the regular sections of a lab report (what you did, what problems you had, how you tested, and what you learned. The project lab report will be worth 100 points. In addition you will receive a grade on a 10 minute presentation to the class. The presentation should be interesting, engaging, informative, and factually correct. It is a good idea to show off your actual work as much as possible (not just talk about it) so you are strongly encouraged to find a way to demonstrate something \"live\" during the presentation. The presentation score is comprised of: Topic Content (30 Points) Was the topic appropriate for the course project? Was the content presented accurate and did it provide a good overview of the topic and the work done? Was the amount of work done appropriate for a large course project? Presentation Skills (30 Points) How well did the group do ''explaining'' the content? Were they able to adequately answer appropriate questions from the class? Was the presentation professional and well prepared? Engagement (20 Points) How well did the group engage the class in their presentation? This could include getting or asking questions of the class, using appropriate visual aids, etc. How well did the group express excitement and interest in the topic of their presentation? Overall Quality (20 Points) Did you learn something or get something clarified in your mind? Did you feel listening to this presentation was worth your time? Was this a \"good\" presentation? Are you interested to learn more about this topic having heard this presentation? Do you have a good understanding of how you could use this to solve future problems you come across? Finally, a small portion of your grade for the project presentation (10% of the presentation score) will be writing a short review of each of the other project presentations. These are not simply participation points for filling out a review, your review will be graded for quality so be sure you listen carefully and provide useful feedback in your review. This section contains information about labs that have been used in this class in the past. You are NOT responsible for completing these labs.

In order to get SIP signaling traffic (port 5060) and RTP audio traffic (ports 10000-20000) to our Asterisk system from our SIP trunking provider we need to forward that traffic to the internal IP address of our Asterisk system. On some firewall devices you could do this just with port forwarding but Cisco does not have a way to forward a large number of ports with a single command (ports 10000-20000 need to all be forwarded for RTP audio traffic). So on our router we’ll use a second outside IP address and forward all traffic to that IP address to our Asterisk server. Note that this effectively puts our Asterisk server on an outside IP address and in a production environment we would want to ensure the Asterisk system has a firewall and other safeguards such as intrusion prevention systems in place to block dangerous traffic. !

Setup one line button on each phone with a valid [[ITC-2300 VoIP Lab Extensions and Numbers|extension number for your pod]]. Assign these lines to the default context. This requires putting a button line in for the phone device section as well as creating a line configuration section in the [[ITC-2300 VoIP Lab Sample sccp.conf File|'''sccp.conf''' file]]. Connect to the Asterisk CLI and issue the reload command Verify you can successfully place a call to Extension 1000 Modify your [[ITC-2300 VoIP Lab Sample extensions.conf File|'''extensions.conf''' file]] to add the two phone extensions and allow calling between phones Test calling between phones Safely shutdown your Debian system, erase your switch/router configuration, and put away all equipment and cables. Be sure to note which phones you have so that next week you’ll be able to get the same two phones.

If you need to split your work up across multiple reservations be sure to safely shutdown your Proxmox VMs before ending your Netlab reservation. Otherwise when your reservation ends Netlab will simply power off your VMs (without shutting them down first) which could cause data corruption. If you make a mistake and need to have one or both of your HV VMs erased so you can re-install Proxmox you will need to contact your instructor or the ITC lab assistant to have them reset. Boot both your Proxmox VE Server systems Check the available container templates on your PVE server and make sure you have downloaded the latest Debian system templates. Also download at least one of the Turnkey Linux appliance templates such as the Wordpress template. If you have an incomplete list of container templates it’s likely the case that your system was powered off when the auto-run script went to check the list of available templates. You can refresh this list manually from the PVE command line using information from the ProxMox Linux Containers page. After you have the containers downloaded go ahead and deploy a container based on the Debian template, use DHCP addressing. Try using the Debian container to see if it feels any different than a regular Debian VM. Create a Proxmox cluster for your pod named \"PodX\" where X is replaced with your pod letter. Do this on the Proxmox node containing your VMs, nodes to be added will not be able to have VMs until after they are added. Add your Proxmox server B to your Proxmox cluster. If you’re having difficulty with this there are two critical requirements that must be met per the documentation and in the instructions from the previous lab: the hostnames of the two Proxmox servers MUST be different AND there can be no VMs on servers being added to a cluster (in this case server B is being added to the cluster). Make sure you have met both requirements. Deploy a Ubuntu container to a node in your Proxmox cluster, verify it is working Deploy a Wordpress server container to a node in your Proxmox cluster, verify it is working Try migrating one of your VMs from the last lab which is NOT powered on from one node to another node in the cluster and then powering up and verifying the VM still works Try migrating one of your Linux containers from one node to another node in the cluster. Note that containers will be powered off while being moved and will then be restarted once the move is complete. Setup some kind of remote access to one of your VMs. That could be Remote Desktop to a Windows VM or SSH to a Linux VM. Use PC-C to open a connection directly to the VM with remote access (SSH to Linux or Remote Desktop to Windows) Try migrating the VM with a remote access connection open (while it is powered on) from one node to another node in the cluster. Make sure you can maintain connectivity and work on the VM the entire time the VM is being migrated. You will need to remove any CD images from the system before it can be migrated. Try modifying an existing VM by adding extra storage, in the form of an additional virtual disk and ensure you can see and use the space inside your VM Try modifying an existing container by adding extra storage, in the form of an additional mount point and ensure you can see and use the space inside your container Try cloning one of your VMs Safely shut down all your containers and VMs Safely shutdown your Proxmox VE servers End your Netlab Reservation Document Build Time: 2022-09-28 20:28:03 -0500 Page Version: 2022.08 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License","title":"Proxmox VE Installation Lab","component":"franske-courses","version":"2022.08","name":"lab-proxmox-containersclusters","url":"/franske-courses/current/itc-2300/lab-proxmox-containersclusters","titles":[{"text":"IP Addressing","hash":"_ip_addressing","id":1},{"text":"Instructions","hash":"_instructions","id":2}]},"21":{"id":21,"text":"You will be assigning static IPs to your systems in this lab.

If you are unsure about how to do something try checking the Proxmox Wiki site first. Be sure to use a unique hostname on each Proxmox server, otherwise you will have issues connecting them together in a future lab. Two hypervisor VMs (labeled HV-A and HV-B) have been provided for you which you will be installing ProxMox VE on, each has: 24GB RAM 300GB Hard Drive 2 CPUs Enabled VTi/VTx Virtualization for the processors VMs are located on the https://netlab.ihitc.net Netlab system, be sure you are signed in to the ITC Passport site through D2L before attempting to access this system You will need to make a reservation for the Proxmox Labs in this class before you are able to access the VMs. Changes will be saved between your reservations so you will be able to make multiple reservations over several days as needed to complete labs.

The Proxmox VE installer ISO file has been pre-loaded into the CD drive of each of your HV VMs Start the Proxmox VE installation (on both VMs) making note of these options: Set the Country to United States and Timezone to America/Chicago Record the administrative password for future use, it is strongly suggested you use \"itc2300\" as the administrative password so that you can reference it here and your instructor can assist with issues in your lab. Set the IP address for each Proxmox system using table above Make sure the hostname is different on each Proxmox VE server and ends with .itc2300.campus.ihitc.net It is recommended you set the name to \"podXproxmoxA.itc2300.campus.ihitc.net\" (change as needed for your pod letter and HV VM ID letter) Once installation is finished use a web browser on PC-C to access the Proxmox VE server’s web interface at the IP address of the hypervisor and login as the root user (username root) and password set during the installation The password for the \"Nelab User\" account on PC-C is \"netlab\" Add a second user account to Proxmox VE and set it up with administrative access. Set the second account up as a Proxmox VE Authentication Server realm account meaning it will only be available in Proxmox and not on the underlying Linux system. You may want to read up about objects and paths for user accounts in Proxmox you will need to set a path for the account in order to get administrative permissions working. This is a bit trickier to get right than it may seem at first. Other students have used the power of Internet searching to find this site about users, groups and permissions in Proxmox VE which they have found helpful. Log out of the root account and login to the Proxmox web administrative interface using the secondary account you just created Use PC-C to upload Windows 10 and Linux Mint ISO files to the Proxmox VE server using the web interface You may have problems uploading the ISO files with the Edge browser so Firefox or Chrome is suggested if you have issues uploading The ISO files can be found on internal website http://172.17.139.70:8080 which you can access from PC-C. Try creating both a Windows 10 and Linux Mint VM (only on Proxmox VE server A!) and complete the installation (use KVM as the VM type) It is recommended that you disconnect/disable the virtual network interface on the Windows 10 system before installing so that you will not need to sign in with a Microsoft account. Don’t forget to re-enable the network interface after completing the installation. Choose that you don’t have a product key when installing Windows, we’ll just use the trial version of Windows 10 Education If you do not see a hard drive to install Windows too it’s possibly your hard drive controller is a model which does not have a driver built in to Windows 10. For example, Windows 10 does not have VirtIO drivers built in by default so it can’t see any drives attached to a VirtIO controller. In this case you’ll need to pick a different controller (which Windows does have built-in drivers for) to get Windows installed. VirtIO devices have better performance though which is why most hypervisors want you to use VirtIO by default. After installing Windows you can manually install drivers for VirtIO support, usually a hypervisor includes a set of drivers on a CD image you can install. VMware calls these additional drivers \"VMware Tools\", VirtualBox calles them \"Guest Additions\", Proxmox has the most unfriendly process of the three which involes installing a \"qemu-guest-agent\" to support shutdown commands and \"VirtIO Drivers\" to achieve the same results. VirtIO drivers are usually baked into Linux installers but must be done manually for Windows (or included in a custom Windows ISO but making one of those is outside the scope of this course). Install the \"VirtIO Drivers\" on your Windows guest system and then change the Windows system to use VirtIO as the hard disk SCSI controller which will improve performance. Install the \"qemu-guest-agent\" on both your Windows and Linux guest systems so that you can shut down and monitor the systems from Proxmox.

Open the installer.exe file found in the vcsa-ui-installer\\win32 directory of the VCSA ISO image and click install to begin the installation process. If you’re unfamiliar with the installation process you can refer back to your readings. During the installation you will need to select ONE of your pod’s ESXi servers to install the vCenter appliance onto. Only one VCSA installation per pod! Set a root password for your VCSA server during the installation process, be sure to write this down! It is strongly suggested you use \"VCSA#itc2300\" as the administrative password so that you can reference it here and your instructor can assist with issues in your lab.

Select the checkbox to enable \"Thin-Disk Mode\" Use the correct static IP address for the VCSA from the allocation you received for your pod above and choose to synchronize time with the ESXi appliance host. The IP address should also be used as the system name. The first phase of the installation will take quite a while to complete. Once it is done you will be prompted to start stage 2 Choose to synchronize time with the ESXi host and enable ssh access When creating a new SSO domain use \"podX.local\" (where X is replaced by your pod letter) as your SSO Domain Name Set the site name to Pod-X (where X is replaced by your pod letter) After the installation completes use your credentials (administrator@podX.local) to log in to the VCSA web client at the address provided.

If you make a mistake and need to have one or both of your HV VMs erased so you can re-install ESXi you will need to contact your instructor or the ITC lab assistant to have them reset. Boot your ESXi Server systems (the two HV systems) Boot your VCSA VM Appliance using the ESXi web interface on the ESXi system hosting VCSA. Use the VCSA web interface to create a new VM which is running on an ESXi server OTHER than the one running VCSA (so more RAM is available) to install Windows Server 2019. You will need a VM with 2GB RAM and a 50GB hard drive minimum. Complete the installation of Windows Server 2019 into the new VM. Click the link that you do not have a key and install the standard version of Server 2019, this will give you a trial license. You will need to upload the ISOs to the datastore on the ESXi system which you are creating the VM on before you can install the systems. This uploading can be done through VCSA from PC-C. The Windows Server 2019 installation ISO files can be found on the internal website http://172.17.139.70:8080 which you can access from PC-C. Add the Active Directory Domain Services role to the server. Use \"podX-ad.local\" (where X is your pod letter) as the root domain name and \"podX-ad\" as the NetBIOS domain name. While the Active Directory role is installed and the domain controller promotion script is running (these will take some time to complete) continue through this lab. It’s sometimes the case that you may have a malfunctioning web interface and need to start some critical VMs such as VCSA and some Active Directory servers only through the host command line interface. We’ll simulate this setup by checking the status and powering on one of your previously installed Linux or Windows VMs through this host console. Use the host command line console on your ESXi machines to get a list of the VMs registered at each host. Use the host command line console on your ESXi machines to check the power status of one of your previously installed Linux or Windows VMs (they should be off) Verify the VMs are off in the vCenter Server web client Use the host command line console on your ESXi machines to power on one of your previously installed Linux or Windows VMs. Verify the VM is powering on through both the host command line console on your ESXi machine as well as through the vCenter web interface. Another useful virtual machine task is to set certain VMs to automatically power on when the ESXi server powers on. Read the VMware documentation on the topic. Set the VCSA VM to automatically power on with the ESXi host. One benefit of the vCenter Server system is that you can migrate VMs from one ESXi host to another. First let’s try this with a powered off virtual machine. Choose one of the powered off VMs on one of your hosts in the VCSA Web Client. On the summary tab check to see which host the VM currently resides on. Right click on it and choose migrate to open the migration wizard. You want to move both the compute (CPU/RAM) and storage (disk images) to a new host so make that selection. Select a different ESXi server and a datastore attached to that server and begin the migration. Once the migration is complete check that the VM shows it is on a different host and verify that it still powers up and works. An even more powerful tool is to be able to migrate VMs while they are running, VMware calls this feature vMotion. Take the same VM and try the migration process again (back to the original host) while the machine is powered on. This may take quite a bit longer to complete so let’s go back to our Windows Server setup while the vMotion magic is happening. It would be nice to have a single sign on for VMware vCenter Server users which is backed by our Active Directory domain so let’s see if we can get that running. Add your Active Directory server as a SSO Identity Source for your vCenter Server using either Integrated Windows Authentication or Active Directory over LDAP. Create a new user account in AD and then try adding it as an administrator in vCenter Server. Try logging in with the new account to your vCenter Server web interface.

Provides the concepts behind and hands-on lab experience with at least three technologies such as VoIP/collaboration, security monitoring, virtualization, storage networking, mobile/BYOD device management which are transforming the IT landscape. External USB3 Drive, 256GB free minimum ITC Info (https://info.ihitc.net) ITC Class Server: http://class.ihitc.net (access via D2L link if you are logged out) Assessments, discussion forums, labs, gradebook, and readings are available here. This class will require on campus lab resources Equipment access, both physical on campus and remote Netlab, is on a first come, first served basis. Additional open on campus lab time may also be available under the supervision of the lab assistant or ITC department instructors, contact the instructor or ITC lab assistant for more information. Students who do not show up for open lab hours they have scheduled may be restricted from registering for open lab hours in the future. The student will be able to: Describe the changing landscape of the IT department Describe at least three current technologies or network applications commonly used or supported by IT departments Demonstrate the ability to perform a basic installation, configuration, and testing of at least three current technologies or network applications commonly used or supported by IT departments Analyze and explain the key features and benefits of three current technologies or network applications commonly used or supported by IT departments Students will practice business soft skills including written, active listening, and oral presentation. Students will document evidence of business skill practice in an electronic portfolio. This course will be taught as a hybrid course with regular instructor meetings. This means that you and your lab partner will be meeting regularly with the instructor during the on campus course time to assess your progress unless you have received special permission from the instructor. Additional details about this are available on the course website. Grades will be determined by performance on unit multiple-choice tests, lab exercises, participation, a skills exam, and a final exam. A description of assignments is available from the course website. It is expected that assignments will be completed and turned in on time and as specified. Failure to turn in one or more assignments without approval from the instructor may result in an additional lack of participation penalty of up to 20% of your overall course grade depending on the type of the assignment. If assignments are turned in late 10% will be deducted for each day or partial day the assignment is late. If you are turning in an assignment late you must contact the instructor for information before the due date. Failure to do so may result in additional penalties. The grading of late assignments is given a lower priority and may take longer so students are encouraged to plan ahead and turn in assignments on time. Penalty-free deadline extensions will not be given without written documentation from a licensed medical practitioner or other extenuating circumstances at the discretion of the instructor. If you miss or do poorly on a regular unit/module/chapter exam (not a final exam or skills final exam) you may petition the instructor to retake the exam once. You will need to write a 400-500 word summary of the unit/module/chapter which is covered by the exam. This summary must be written by you personally, the use of any automatic summarization tools or summaries by others will be considered cheating on the exam and is subject to the academic integrity policies covered elsewhere. Your summary must also be written to the satisfaction of the instructor. Retakes or make-ups must be completed by the date specified by the instructor. There is generally no additional late penalty for an exam retake other than needing to write and submit the summary. Letter Grade Percentage Range Description A 100%-90% achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements B 89%-80% achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet course requirements C 79%-70% achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect D 69%-65% achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully the course requirements F 64%-0% Represents failure and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) N Represents no credit and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) I Represents incomplete and is assigned at the discretion of the instructor when, due to extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student is prevented from completing the work of the course on time. Requires a written agreement between instructor and student. Students must request an incomplete from the instructor. Grades for this course are calculated based on a weighted points system. Each assignment, quiz or test is assigned to one of the weighted categories below and is graded on a points system. Your percentage is calculated for each category by dividing the points earned in that category by the points available. Finally, your percentage earned in each category is multiplied by the weight of that category and these are added together. The instructor may round up based on student participation and individual improvement. Category Percent of Final Grade Topic Assessments 20% Lab/Homework Assignments 40% Regular Final Exam 15% Case Study Project 15% Participation Activities 10% Detailed information about assignments and which category they are included in is on the \"Assignments\" page of the course website. Mid-Term grades are not officially distributed but assignment scores are made available in the online grade book as assignments are graded and you may calculate your current course grade at any time using the above instructions and weighting. It is strongly suggested that if you want to know where you stand in the class you re-create your own copy of the gradebook with appropriate weights in a spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets where you can estimate scores you will likely get on future assignments and run other \"what-if\" scenarios. Be aware that the final grade in online gradebooks may be calculated in a way which ignores any assignments you have not turned in. At the end of the semester assignments which have not been turned in will have scores of 0 recorded in the gradebook. If you have missing assignments this may cause your grade to suddenly drop from what was previously shown. It is your responsibility to know what assignments you have not completed, that those will become 0s if not turned in, and how that will affect your grade. Students should not rely on extra credit to boost their grade and should instead complete each assignment to the best of their ability. However, from time to time extra credit opportunities may arise at which time they will be announced in class, by email and/or through the course website. Unless otherwise noted extra credit will be added to the Lab/Homework Assignments category. In the case of lab activities which are designed to use physical lab equipment you must work on physical lab equipment, no simulators are allowed. Unless specific permission is given by the instructor this means you must use the IHCC lab equipment on campus or the IHCC Netlab remote lab system. Any evidence that you have turned in a lab report for a lab which is designed to be completed on physical equipment without using physical equipment will be treated as cheating. See the course and campus policies section below for additional information on cheating policies. After the first class meeting formal attendance will not be taken; however, students are expected to arrive to class on time and participate in class. Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled. If attendance is a problem participation assignments may be given and included in the course grade. If an illness or emergency results in an absence, students should contact their instructors as soon as possible to determine if missed work can be completed. A student may receive a course grade of FN or NC after two consecutive weeks of unexcused absence at any time during the semester. Class attendance is defined as being physically present in the classroom. Online attendance is defined as having submitted an assignment, taken a quiz, or posted/made a course content-related comment on the discussion/chat board for the course in which the student is registered. You will need daily access to a high-speed internet connection (DSL, cable modem, 4G, fiber, or equivalent) and a modern computer to successfully complete this course. Academic integrity is one of the most important values in higher education. This principle requires that each student’s work represents his or her own personal efforts and that the student acknowledges the intellectual contributions of others. The foundation for this principle is student academic honesty. IHCC students are expected to honor the requirements of the College Academic Integrity Policy. The following are some examples of unacceptable academic practices that will be viewed as policy violations. It is unacceptable to submit the work of another person as your own. If you quote, summarize, paraphrase, or use the ideas of another, you must accurately attribute that information. If you do not acknowledge the source, you are plagiarizing. Academic dishonesty also includes unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting the same assignment for multiple classes without instructor permission; taking an examination for another person and many other situations. If you are unsure whether you are plagiarizing or how to cite a source please ask an instructor or staff member for help prior to turning in the assignment. In this course, the first offense of plagiarism and/or cheating will result in a score of zero on the assignment, quiz or test and reporting of the incident to college administration. Further plagiarism and/or cheating may result in immediate failure of the course and additional consequences determined by college administration. If you have cheated in other ITC courses that will count as your first offense. In other words, if you have cheated in ITC courses before cheating in this course may result in immediately failing the course and additional consequences determined by college administration. All instances of cheating will be reported to the college administration. In addition, plagiarism and cheating are covered by the Student Code of Conduct. Please see the Catalog or IHCC website for details. Students must initiate requests for withdrawal from a course by filing the appropriate form with Enrollment Services. Students who stop attending classes without completing the withdrawal process may receive a grade of “F,” and are responsible for all tuition/fees associated with the course registration. The last day to withdraw from your course will be the date on which 80% of the course has elapsed. The last day to withdraw for each course can be viewed in E-Services by searching for the course at the following link: https://webproc.mnscu.edu/registration/search/basic.html?campusid=157. Click on the course title to view additional details about the course, including last day to withdraw. There are limits as to the latest date you can withdraw from the course and still receive a refund as well as the last date to withdraw from the course at all. Please see the Add, Drop and Withdraw page on the IHCC website: https://inverhills.edu/Registration/AddDropWithdraw.aspx Recognizing the value and efficiency of communication between faculty/staff and students through electronic mail Inver Hills Community College has designated e-mail as an official mode of communication. At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. Therefore, students are asked to regularly check and utilize the email address they have registered with the college. If your email address has changed it is your responsibility to make sure the college has an up-to date email address where you can be contacted. You should check your email on a regular basis as course changes and communications may be sent by email. A student may elect to take a course on a pass/fail (P/F) grading basis by contacting the instructor within the first 5 business days of the semester, or within 1 business day of the start date for a course beginning after the first week of the semester. If the instructor approves, they will submit approval to the Enrollment Center. Not all courses are approved for students to elect the P/F grading method and there may be limits to the total number of classes which can be taken pass/fail in your degree or certificate program. Contact your instructor for details about what level of achievement in the course will be required to receive a pass in the course. Inver Hills values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to fostering mutual respect and full participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning environment that is equitable, inclusive and welcoming. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to your inclusion or learning, please notify me. The Office of Accessibility Resources (OAR) provides reasonable accommodations and assistive technologies for students who encounter barriers in the learning environment. Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. If you have already registered with OAR and have your Letter of Accommodation, please meet with me early in the course to discuss, plan, and implement your accommodations in the course. For additional information, please contact OAR located within the Learning Center (L207), 651-450-3884, accessibilityresources@inverhills.edu or https://www.inverhills.edu/LearningSupport/AccessibilityResources/index.aspx In accordance with federal and state laws, Inver Hills Community College is committed to a policy of free expression and respect for the diversity of beliefs, including religious observances, among our academic community. It is the policy of the college to provide reasonable accommodations for students when religious beliefs and/or observances conflict with classroom activities or course requirements. It is the responsibility of students to notify instructors of the need for accommodation at the beginning of the course or as soon as a situation arises. If a mutually agreed accommodation is not made, a student may initiate a complaint. The procedure for filing a complaint is described in the Catalog and on the Inver Hills website. The complaint must be filed within 15 days of a denied accommodation request. The instructor reserves the right to modify and adjust this syllabus as needed during the course of this class. The most up to date version will always be available on the course website or from the instructor.

Failure to turn in one or more assignments without approval from the instructor may result in an additional lack of participation penalty of up to 20% of your course grade depending on the type of the assignment. If assignments are turned in late 10% will be deducted for each day or partial day the assignment is late. If you are turning in an assignment late you must contact the instructor for information before the due date. Failure to do so may result in additional penalties. The grading of late assignments is given a lower priority and may take longer so students are encouraged to plan ahead and turn in assignments on time. Penalty-free deadline extensions will not be given without written documentation from a licensed medical practitioner or other extenuating circumstances at the discretion of the instructor. Letter Grade Percentage Range Description A 100%-90% achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements B 89%-80% achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet course requirements C 79%-70% achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect D 69%-65% achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully the course requirements F 64%-0% Represents failure and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) N Represents no credit and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) I Represents incomplete and is assigned at the discretion of the instructor when, due to extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student is prevented from completing the work of the course on time. Requires a written agreement between instructor and student. Students must request an incomplete from the instructor. Grades for this course are calculated based on a weighted points system. Each assignment, quiz or test is assigned to one of the weighted categories below and is graded on a points system. Your percentage is calculated for each category by dividing the points earned in that category by the points available. Finally, your percentage earned in each category is multiplied by the weight of that category and these are added together. The instructor may round up based on student participation and individual improvement. Category Percent of Final Grade Topic Assessments 20% Lab Assignments 30% Written Final Exam 15% Skills Based Final Exam 15% Homework, Activities & Participation 20% Mid-Term grades are not officially distributed but assignment scores are made available in the online grade book as assignments are graded and you may calculate your current course grade at any time using the above instructions and weighting. It is strongly suggested that if you want to know where you stand in the class you re-create your own copy of the gradebook with appropriate weights in a spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets where you can estimate scores you will likely get on future assignments and run other \"what-if\" scenarios. Be aware that the final grade in online gradebooks may be calculated in a way which ignores any assignments you have not turned in. At the end of the semester assignments which have not been turned in will have scores of 0 recorded in the gradebook. If you have missing assignments this may cause your grade to suddenly drop from what was previously shown. It is your responsibility to know what assignments you have not completed, that those will become 0s if not turned in, and how that will affect your grade. === Extra Credit Students should not rely on extra credit to boost their grade and should instead complete each assignment to the best of their ability. However, from time to time extra credit opportunities may arise at which time they will be announced in class, by email and/or through the course website. Extra credit will be added to the Homework, Activities & Participation category. After the first class meeting formal attendance will not be taken; however, students are expected to arrive to class on time and participate in class. Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled. If attendance is a problem participation assignments may be given and included in the course grade. If an illness or emergency results in an absence, students should contact their instructors as soon as possible to determine if missed work can be completed. A student may receive a course grade of FN or NC after two consecutive weeks of unexcused absence at any time during the semester. Class attendance is defined as being physically present in the classroom. Online attendance is defined as having submitted an assignment, taken a quiz, or posted/made a course content-related comment on the discussion/chat board for the course in which the student is registered. You will need daily access to a high-speed internet connection (DSL, cable modem, 4G, fiber, or equivalent) and a modern computer to successfully complete this course. Academic integrity is one of the most important values in higher education. This principle requires that each student’s work represents his or her own personal efforts and that the student acknowledges the intellectual contributions of others. The foundation for this principle is student academic honesty. IHCC students are expected to honor the requirements of the College Academic Integrity Policy. The following are some examples of unacceptable academic practices that will be viewed as policy violations. It is unacceptable to submit the work of another person as your own. If you quote, summarize, paraphrase, or use the ideas of another, you must accurately attribute that information. If you do not acknowledge the source, you are plagiarizing. Academic dishonesty also includes unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting the same assignment for multiple classes without instructor permission; taking an examination for another person and many other situations. If you are unsure whether you are plagiarizing or how to cite a source please ask an instructor or staff member for help prior to turning in the assignment. In this course, the first offense of plagiarism and/or cheating will result in a score of zero on the assignment, quiz or test and reporting of the incident to college administration. Further plagiarism and/or cheating may result in immediate failure of the course and additional consequences determined by college administration. If you have cheated in other ITC courses that will count as your first offense. In other words, if you have cheated in ITC courses before cheating in this course may result in immediately failing the course and additional consequences determined by college administration. All instances of cheating will be reported to the college administration. In addition, plagiarism and cheating are covered by the Student Code of Conduct. Please see the Catalog or IHCC website for details. Students must initiate requests for withdrawal from a course by filing the appropriate form with Enrollment Services. Students who stop attending classes without completing the withdrawal process may receive a grade of “F,” and are responsible for all tuition/fees associated with the course registration. The last day to withdraw from your course will be the date on which 80% of the course has elapsed. The last day to withdraw for each course can be viewed in E-Services by searching for the course at the following link: https://webproc.mnscu.edu/registration/search/basic.html?campusid=157. Click on the course title to view additional details about the course, including last day to withdraw. There are limits as to the latest date you can withdraw from the course and still receive a refund as well as the last date to withdraw from the course at all. Please see the Add, Drop and Withdraw page on the IHCC website: https://inverhills.edu/Registration/AddDropWithdraw.aspx Recognizing the value and efficiency of communication between faculty/staff and students through electronic mail Inver Hills Community College has designated e-mail as an official mode of communication. At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. Therefore, students are asked to regularly check and utilize the email address they have registered with the college. If your email address has changed it is your responsibility to make sure the college has an up-to date email address where you can be contacted. You should check your email on a regular basis as course changes and communications may be sent by email. A student may elect to take a course on a pass/fail (P/F) grading basis by contacting the instructor within the first 5 business days of the semester, or within 1 business day of the start date for a course beginning after the first week of the semester. If the instructor approves, they will submit approval to the Enrollment Center. Not all courses are approved for students to elect the P/F grading method and there may be limits to the total number of classes which can be taken pass/fail in your degree or certificate program. Contact your instructor for details about what level of achievement in the course will be required to receive a pass in the course. Inver Hills values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to fostering mutual respect and full participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning environment that is equitable, inclusive and welcoming. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to your inclusion or learning, please notify me. The Office of Accessibility Resources (OAR) provides reasonable accommodations and assistive technologies for students who encounter barriers in the learning environment.

Equipment Labs in the CCNA 1 portion of the class must be completed with physical equipment on campus or at home with your own equipment (requires advance instructor permission). Equipment Labs in the CCNA 2 portion of the class must be completed with physical equipment on campus or at home with your own equipment (requires advance instructor permission) unless the instructor gives you special permission to use Netlab remote access equipment based on your progress in the course. Equipment access, both physical on campus and remote Netlab, is on a first come, first served basis. Packet Tracer Labs may be completed on campus or at home and submitted through the ScoreUP system. Additional open on campus lab time may also be available under the supervision of the lab assistant or ITC department instructors, contact the instructor or ITC lab assistant for more information. Students who do not show up for open lab hours they have scheduled may be restricted from registering for open lab hours in the future. The student will be able to: Explain the advances in modern network technologies.

Configure IPv4 and IPv6 floating static routes. Explain how to troubleshoot static and default route configurations. Students will practice business soft skills including written, active listening, and oral presentation. This course will be taught as a hybrid course with regular instructor meetings. This means that you and your lab partner will be meeting regularly with the instructor during the on campus course time to assess your progress unless you have received special permission from the instructor. Additional details about this are available on the course website. Grades will be determined by performance on unit multiple-choice tests, lab exercises, participation, a skills exam, and a final exam. A description of assignments is available from the course website. It is expected that assignments will be completed and turned in on time and as specified. Failure to turn in one or more assignments without approval from the instructor may result in an additional lack of participation penalty of up to 20% of your overall course grade depending on the type of the assignment. If assignments are turned in late 10% will be deducted for each day or partial day the assignment is late. If you are turning in an assignment late you must contact the instructor for information before the due date. Failure to do so may result in additional penalties. The grading of late assignments is given a lower priority and may take longer so students are encouraged to plan ahead and turn in assignments on time. Penalty-free deadline extensions will not be given without written documentation from a licensed medical practitioner or other extenuating circumstances at the discretion of the instructor. If you miss or do poorly on a regular unit/module/chapter exam (not a final exam or skills final exam) you may petition the instructor to retake the exam once. You will need to write a 400-500 word summary of the unit/module/chapter which is covered by the exam. This summary must be written by you personally, the use of any automatic summarization tools or summaries by others will be considered cheating on the exam and is subject to the academic integrity policies covered elsewhere. Your summary must also be written to the satisfaction of the instructor. Retakes or make-ups must be completed by the date specified by the instructor. There is generally no additional late penalty for an exam retake other than needing to write and submit the summary. Letter Grade Percentage Range Description A 100%-90% achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements B 89%-80% achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet course requirements C 79%-70% achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect D 69%-65% achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully the course requirements F 64%-0% Represents failure and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) N Represents no credit and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) I Represents incomplete and is assigned at the discretion of the instructor when, due to extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student is prevented from completing the work of the course on time. Requires a written agreement between instructor and student. Students must request an incomplete from the instructor. This course is a combination of two Cisco Networking Academy courses, CCNA 1 and CCNA 2. Grades for each of these two courses will be calculated separately following the method below and then the two courses will be averaged for a final grade in the single 6 credit college course. Grades for each course is calculated based on a weighted points system. Each assignment, quiz or test is assigned to one of the weighted categories below and is graded on a points system. Your percentage is calculated for each category by dividing the points earned in that category by the points available. Finally, your percentage earned in each category is multiplied by the weight of that category and these are added together. The instructor may round up based on student participation and individual improvement. Category Percent of Final Grade Unit Assessments 20% Lab/Homework Assignments 35% Regular Final Exam 15% Skills Based Final Exam 15% Participation Activities 15% Detailed information about assignments and which category they are included in is on the \"Assignments\" page of the course website. Mid-Term grades are not officially distributed but assignment scores are made available in the online grade book as assignments are graded and you may calculate your current course grade at any time using the above instructions and weighting. It is strongly suggested that if you want to know where you stand in the class you re-create your own copy of the gradebook with appropriate weights in a spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets where you can estimate scores you will likely get on future assignments and run other \"what-if\" scenarios. Be aware that the final grade in online gradebooks may be calculated in a way which ignores any assignments you have not turned in. At the end of the semester assignments which have not been turned in will have scores of 0 recorded in the gradebook. If you have missing assignments this may cause your grade to suddenly drop from what was previously shown. It is your responsibility to know what assignments you have not completed, that those will become 0s if not turned in, and how that will affect your grade. Students should not rely on extra credit to boost their grade and should instead complete each assignment to the best of their ability. However, from time to time extra credit opportunities may arise at which time they will be announced in class, by email and/or through the course website. Unless otherwise noted extra credit will be added to the Lab/Homework Assignments category. It is unacceptable to look for or find copies of exams, exam questions, or scenarios online and use them to complete your exam. Answering a question or scenario incorrectly based on the exam you are taking but in a way that was indicated as correct on a version of the exam which was found online will be seen as evidence of intentional cheating. You will receive a penalty and it will be reported as indicated in the course and campus policies section below. In plain English…​ I know some copies of exams for this course circulate online. I look at these and may modify the exam you are given so that a different answer is correct for what looks to be a similar question. You may call these \"trick questions\" but in this case they are only a trick question if you have seen a stolen copy of an old exam. If you answer one or more of these as shown on the stolen exam this will be evidence of cheating and you will be punished according to cheating policies. Do not cheat, do not look for or use stolen exams. See the course and campus policies section below for additional information on cheating policies. In the case of Packet Tracer activities this means you must start with the file provided by your instructor or as part of the curriculum and complete the activity yourself. You may of course ask others for help figuring something out but you must do the work yourself. Do not simply follow tutorials or videos from start to finish showing how to complete the activity as that will not allow you to learn the process and you will likely score poorly on lab exams. You may never ask anyone else to complete an activity for you or turn in an activity completed by someone else, this will be treated as cheating. In the case of lab activities which are designed to use physical lab equipment you must work on physical lab equipment, no simulators are allowed. Unless specific permission is given by the instructor this means you must use the IHCC lab equipment on campus or the IHCC Netlab remote lab system. Any evidence that you have turned in a lab report for a lab which is designed to be completed on physical equipment without using physical equipment will be treated as cheating. See the course and campus policies section below for additional information on cheating policies. After the first class meeting formal attendance will not be taken; however, students are expected to arrive to class on time and participate in class. Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled. If attendance is a problem participation assignments may be given and included in the course grade. If an illness or emergency results in an absence, students should contact their instructors as soon as possible to determine if missed work can be completed. A student may receive a course grade of FN or NC after two consecutive weeks of unexcused absence at any time during the semester. Class attendance is defined as being physically present in the classroom. Online attendance is defined as having submitted an assignment, taken a quiz, or posted/made a course content-related comment on the discussion/chat board for the course in which the student is registered. You will need daily access to a high-speed internet connection (DSL, cable modem, 4G, fiber, or equivalent) and a modern computer to successfully complete this course. Academic integrity is one of the most important values in higher education. This principle requires that each student’s work represents his or her own personal efforts and that the student acknowledges the intellectual contributions of others. The foundation for this principle is student academic honesty. IHCC students are expected to honor the requirements of the College Academic Integrity Policy. The following are some examples of unacceptable academic practices that will be viewed as policy violations. It is unacceptable to submit the work of another person as your own. If you quote, summarize, paraphrase, or use the ideas of another, you must accurately attribute that information. If you do not acknowledge the source, you are plagiarizing. Academic dishonesty also includes unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting the same assignment for multiple classes without instructor permission; taking an examination for another person and many other situations. If you are unsure whether you are plagiarizing or how to cite a source please ask an instructor or staff member for help prior to turning in the assignment. In this course, the first offense of plagiarism and/or cheating will result in a score of zero on the assignment, quiz or test and reporting of the incident to college administration. Further plagiarism and/or cheating may result in immediate failure of the course and additional consequences determined by college administration. If you have cheated in other ITC courses that will count as your first offense. In other words, if you have cheated in ITC courses before cheating in this course may result in immediately failing the course and additional consequences determined by college administration. All instances of cheating will be reported to the college administration. In addition, plagiarism and cheating are covered by the Student Code of Conduct. Please see the Catalog or IHCC website for details. Students must initiate requests for withdrawal from a course by filing the appropriate form with Enrollment Services. Students who stop attending classes without completing the withdrawal process may receive a grade of “F,” and are responsible for all tuition/fees associated with the course registration. The last day to withdraw from your course will be the date on which 80% of the course has elapsed. The last day to withdraw for each course can be viewed in E-Services by searching for the course at the following link: https://webproc.mnscu.edu/registration/search/basic.html?campusid=157. Click on the course title to view additional details about the course, including last day to withdraw. There are limits as to the latest date you can withdraw from the course and still receive a refund as well as the last date to withdraw from the course at all. Please see the Add, Drop and Withdraw page on the IHCC website: https://inverhills.edu/Registration/AddDropWithdraw.aspx Recognizing the value and efficiency of communication between faculty/staff and students through electronic mail Inver Hills Community College has designated e-mail as an official mode of communication. At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. Therefore, students are asked to regularly check and utilize the email address they have registered with the college. If your email address has changed it is your responsibility to make sure the college has an up-to date email address where you can be contacted. You should check your email on a regular basis as course changes and communications may be sent by email. A student may elect to take a course on a pass/fail (P/F) grading basis by contacting the instructor within the first 5 business days of the semester, or within 1 business day of the start date for a course beginning after the first week of the semester. If the instructor approves, they will submit approval to the Enrollment Center. Not all courses are approved for students to elect the P/F grading method and there may be limits to the total number of classes which can be taken pass/fail in your degree or certificate program. Contact your instructor for details about what level of achievement in the course will be required to receive a pass in the course. Inver Hills values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to fostering mutual respect and full participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning environment that is equitable, inclusive and welcoming. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to your inclusion or learning, please notify me. The Office of Accessibility Resources (OAR) provides reasonable accommodations and assistive technologies for students who encounter barriers in the learning environment.

Focuses on implementing core enterprise network technologies including dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) architecture, virtualization, layer 2, 3, and wireless infrastructure, network assurance, security and automation. This is the first of two courses preparing students for the Cisco Certified Network Professional Enterprise certification. Official Cert Guide: CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 (Edgeworth, Garza Rios, Gooley, Hucaby) ISBN: 978-1587145230 CAUTION: Yes, This textbook really is required. Unlike many Cisco Networking Academy classes there is not a free online version on Netacad! TIP: The first edition printed version of this book has many errors in it. You can avoid these errors by getting the ebook version from the publisher Cisco Press. Note that Amazon and other ebook versions are not necessarily updated. CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core & CCNP Enterprise Advanced Routing Portable Command Guide (Empson, Gargano) ISBN: 978-0135768167 ITC Info (https://info.ihitc.net) Cisco Networking Academy (http://www.netacad.com) It is important that you keep an accurate email address on file with the Cisco Networking Academy site and/or regularly sign on to the site to check your Networking Academy Inbox. Important and time-sensitive course information may be distributed through the Networking Academy messaging system. If you have an accurate email address you can receive the information by email as well. Packet Tracer can not be used to complete labs in this course All labs for this class may be completed remotely using the Netlab system Equipment access, both physical on campus and remote Netlab, is on a first come, first served basis. Open on campus lab time may also be available under the supervision of the lab assistant or ITC department instructors, contact the instructor or ITC lab assistant for more information. Students who do not show up for open lab hours they have scheduled may be restricted from registering for open lab hours in the future. If you are struggling with labs it’s strongly suggested you make arrangements to come to campus and work on them where you can get more immediate help if you get stuck. The student will be able to: Explain the different design principles used in an enterprise network Analyze design principles of a WLAN deployment Differentiate between on-premises and cloud infrastructure deployments Explain the working principles of the Cisco SD-WAN solution Explain the working principles of the Cisco SD-Access solution Describe concepts of wired and wireless QoS Differentiate hardware and software switching mechanisms Describe device virtualization technologies Configure and verify data path virtualization technologies Describe network virtualization concepts Troubleshoot static and dynamic 802.1q trunking protocols Troubleshoot static and dynamic EtherChannels Configure and verify common Spanning Tree Protocols (RSTP and MST) Compare routing concepts of EIGRP and OSPF (advanced distance vector vs. linked state, load balancing, path selection, path operations, metrics) Configure and verify simple OSPF environments, including multiple normal areas, summarization, and filtering (neighbor adjacency, point-to-point and broadcast network types, and passive interface) Configure and verify eBGP between directly connected neighbors (best path selection algorithm and neighbor relationships) Describe Layer 1 wireless concepts, such as RF power, RSSI, SNR, interference noise, band and channels, and wireless client devices capabilities Describe AP modes and antenna types Describe access point discovery and join process (discovery algorithms, WLC selection process) Describe the main principles and use cases for Layer 2 and Layer 3 roaming Troubleshoot WLAN configuration and wireless client connectivity issues Describe Network Time Protocol (NTP) Configure and verify NAT/PAT Configure first hop redundancy protocols, such as HSRP and VRRP Describe multicast protocols, such as PIM and IGMP v2/v3 Diagnose network problems using tools such as debugs, conditional debugs, trace route,ping, SNMP, and syslog Configure and verify device monitoring using syslog for remote logging Configure and verify NetFlow and Flexible NetFlow Configure and verify SPAN/RSPAN/ERSPAN Configure and verify IPSLA Describe Cisco DNA Center workflows to apply network configuration, monitoring, and management Configure and verify NETCONF and RESTCONF Configure and verify device access control Configure and verify infrastructure security features Describe REST API security Configure and verify wireless security features Describe the components of network security design Interpret basic Python components and scripts Construct valid JSON encoded file Describe the high-level principles and benefits of a data modeling language, such as YANG Describe APIs for Cisco DNA Center and vManage Interpret REST API response codes and results in payload using Cisco DNA Center and RESTCONF Construct EEM applet to automate configuration, troubleshooting, or data collection Compare agent vs. agentless orchestration tools, such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack This course will be taught as a fully online course with regular synchronous instructor meetings. This means that you will be meeting regularly with the instructor in an online web conference call during the scheduled course time to assess your progress. Additional details about this are available on the course website. Grades will be determined by performance on unit multiple-choice tests, lab exercises, participation, a skills exam, and a final exam. A description of assignments is available from the course website. It is expected that assignments will be completed and turned in on time and as specified. Failure to turn in one or more assignments without approval from the instructor may result in an additional lack of participation penalty of up to 20% of your overall course grade depending on the type of the assignment. If assignments are turned in late 10% will be deducted for each day or partial day the assignment is late. If you are turning in an assignment late you must contact the instructor for information before the due date. Failure to do so may result in additional penalties. The grading of late assignments is given a lower priority and may take longer so students are encouraged to plan ahead and turn in assignments on time. Penalty-free deadline extensions will not be given without written documentation from a licensed medical practitioner or other extenuating circumstances at the discretion of the instructor. If you miss or do poorly on a regular unit/module/chapter exam (not a final exam or skills final exam) you may petition the instructor to retake the exam once. You will need to write a 400-500 word summary of the unit/module/chapter which is covered by the exam. This summary must be written by you personally, the use of any automatic summarization tools or summaries by others will be considered cheating on the exam and is subject to the academic integrity policies covered elsewhere. Your summary must also be written to the satisfaction of the instructor. Retakes or make-ups must be completed by the date specified by the instructor. There is generally no additional late penalty for an exam retake other than needing to write and submit the summary. Letter Grade Percentage Range Description A 100%-90% achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements B 89%-80% achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet course requirements C 79%-70% achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect D 69%-65% achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully the course requirements F 64%-0% Represents failure and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) N Represents no credit and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) I Represents incomplete and is assigned at the discretion of the instructor when, due to extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student is prevented from completing the work of the course on time. Requires a written agreement between instructor and student. Students must request an incomplete from the instructor. Grades for this course are calculated based on a weighted points system. Each assignment, quiz or test is assigned to one of the weighted categories below and is graded on a points system. Your percentage is calculated for each category by dividing the points earned in that category by the points available. Finally, your percentage earned in each category is multiplied by the weight of that category and these are added together. The instructor may round up based on student participation and individual improvement. Category Percent of Final Grade Unit Assessments 20% Lab/Homework Assignments 35% Regular Final Exam 15% Skills Based Final Exam 15% Participation Activities 15% Detailed information about assignments and which category they are included in is on the \"Assignments\" page of the course website. Mid-Term grades are not officially distributed but assignment scores are made available in the online grade book as assignments are graded and you may calculate your current course grade at any time using the above instructions and weighting. It is strongly suggested that if you want to know where you stand in the class you re-create your own copy of the gradebook with appropriate weights in a spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets where you can estimate scores you will likely get on future assignments and run other \"what-if\" scenarios. Be aware that the final grade in online gradebooks may be calculated in a way which ignores any assignments you have not turned in. At the end of the semester assignments which have not been turned in will have scores of 0 recorded in the gradebook. If you have missing assignments this may cause your grade to suddenly drop from what was previously shown. It is your responsibility to know what assignments you have not completed, that those will become 0s if not turned in, and how that will affect your grade. Students should not rely on extra credit to boost their grade and should instead complete each assignment to the best of their ability. However, from time to time extra credit opportunities may arise at which time they will be announced in class, by email and/or through the course website. Unless otherwise noted extra credit will be added to the Lab/Homework Assignments category. It is unacceptable to look for or find copies of exams, exam questions, or scenarios online and use them to complete your exam. Answering a question or scenario incorrectly based on the exam you are taking but in a way that was indicated as correct on a version of the exam which was found online will be seen as evidence of intentional cheating. You will receive a penalty and it will be reported as indicated in the course and campus policies section below. In plain English…​ I know some copies of exams for this course circulate online. I look at these and may modify the exam you are given so that a different answer is correct for what looks to be a similar question. You may call these \"trick questions\" but in this case they are only a trick question if you have seen a stolen copy of an old exam. If you answer one or more of these as shown on the stolen exam this will be evidence of cheating and you will be punished according to cheating policies. Do not cheat, do not look for or use stolen exams. See the course and campus policies section below for additional information on cheating policies. In the case of lab activities which are designed to use physical lab equipment you must work on physical lab equipment, no simulators are allowed. Unless specific permission is given by the instructor this means you must use the IHCC lab equipment on campus or the IHCC Netlab remote lab system. Any evidence that you have turned in a lab report for a lab which is designed to be completed on physical equipment without using physical equipment will be treated as cheating. See the course and campus policies section below for additional information on cheating policies. After the first class meeting formal attendance will not be taken; however, students are expected to arrive to class on time and participate in class. Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled. If attendance is a problem participation assignments may be given and included in the course grade. If an illness or emergency results in an absence, students should contact their instructors as soon as possible to determine if missed work can be completed. A student may receive a course grade of FN or NC after two consecutive weeks of unexcused absence at any time during the semester. Class attendance is defined as being physically present in the classroom. Online attendance is defined as having submitted an assignment, taken a quiz, or posted/made a course content-related comment on the discussion/chat board for the course in which the student is registered. You will need daily access to a high-speed internet connection (DSL, cable modem, 4G, fiber, or equivalent) and a modern computer to successfully complete this course. Academic integrity is one of the most important values in higher education. This principle requires that each student’s work represents his or her own personal efforts and that the student acknowledges the intellectual contributions of others. The foundation for this principle is student academic honesty. IHCC students are expected to honor the requirements of the College Academic Integrity Policy. The following are some examples of unacceptable academic practices that will be viewed as policy violations. It is unacceptable to submit the work of another person as your own. If you quote, summarize, paraphrase, or use the ideas of another, you must accurately attribute that information. If you do not acknowledge the source, you are plagiarizing. Academic dishonesty also includes unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting the same assignment for multiple classes without instructor permission; taking an examination for another person and many other situations. If you are unsure whether you are plagiarizing or how to cite a source please ask an instructor or staff member for help prior to turning in the assignment. In this course, the first offense of plagiarism and/or cheating will result in a score of zero on the assignment, quiz or test and reporting of the incident to college administration. Further plagiarism and/or cheating may result in immediate failure of the course and additional consequences determined by college administration. If you have cheated in other ITC courses that will count as your first offense. In other words, if you have cheated in ITC courses before cheating in this course may result in immediately failing the course and additional consequences determined by college administration. All instances of cheating will be reported to the college administration. In addition, plagiarism and cheating are covered by the Student Code of Conduct. Please see the Catalog or IHCC website for details. Students must initiate requests for withdrawal from a course by filing the appropriate form with Enrollment Services. Students who stop attending classes without completing the withdrawal process may receive a grade of “F,” and are responsible for all tuition/fees associated with the course registration. The last day to withdraw from your course will be the date on which 80% of the course has elapsed. The last day to withdraw for each course can be viewed in E-Services by searching for the course at the following link: https://webproc.mnscu.edu/registration/search/basic.html?campusid=157. Click on the course title to view additional details about the course, including last day to withdraw. There are limits as to the latest date you can withdraw from the course and still receive a refund as well as the last date to withdraw from the course at all. Please see the Add, Drop and Withdraw page on the IHCC website: https://inverhills.edu/Registration/AddDropWithdraw.aspx Recognizing the value and efficiency of communication between faculty/staff and students through electronic mail Inver Hills Community College has designated e-mail as an official mode of communication. At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. Therefore, students are asked to regularly check and utilize the email address they have registered with the college. If your email address has changed it is your responsibility to make sure the college has an up-to date email address where you can be contacted. You should check your email on a regular basis as course changes and communications may be sent by email. A student may elect to take a course on a pass/fail (P/F) grading basis by contacting the instructor within the first 5 business days of the semester, or within 1 business day of the start date for a course beginning after the first week of the semester. If the instructor approves, they will submit approval to the Enrollment Center. Not all courses are approved for students to elect the P/F grading method and there may be limits to the total number of classes which can be taken pass/fail in your degree or certificate program. Contact your instructor for details about what level of achievement in the course will be required to receive a pass in the course. Inver Hills values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to fostering mutual respect and full participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning environment that is equitable, inclusive and welcoming. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to your inclusion or learning, please notify me. The Office of Accessibility Resources (OAR) provides reasonable accommodations and assistive technologies for students who encounter barriers in the learning environment.

The various sections of the report are clearly identified and all sections of the report were addresses/included in the report. There are a few typos and grammatical mistakes in the report and there is probably a little too much detail included in the \"What we did/What was the purpose\" section of the report. What we did/What was the purpose Today we disassembled and reassembled a desktop computer. After putting on an anti-ESD wrist strap and grounding it, Adam and I started by removing both sides of the case and taking out the mounting screws for the optical drive and HDD. Doing this first, but not intentionally, reminded us to make sure we had a means to keep our tiny screws contained and organized. We then started disconnecting all power cables from the PSU, the serial port, the front panel wires to the motherboard and both SATA cables. (I’m actually glad we didn’t look before blindly disconnecting them, as it only reinforced the need to cross check the diagrams on the inside of the case later on.) With all cables disconnected we could start taking out components. Without any screws keeping them safely stable, the first two taken out were the optical and HDD, then the serial port and the GPU. With all components out the way we could now remove the motherboard. (We waited on its mounting screws so as not to accidentally dislodge the board and damage it earlier on.) After removing the board we could now take out the RAM, take off the CPU fan and remove the CPU from the ZIF, placing them safely on some anti-static plastic. Fully disassembled we were ready for reassembly. Reassembly abridged: RAM, CPU, fan, mobo w/mounting screws, serial, GPU (later discovered to be a pain in the butt when trying to connect front panel audio power), optical drive and HDD w/mounting screws, power connectors, data cables. After reassembly assessment, we failed to properly install the CPU fan and serial cable. Reasons for both included guesswork letting us down. It “seemed” tight enough and it “looked” like it was connected right. Nope. After they were fixed we finished closing it up, connected peripherals and powered it on. All was good except for the power light indicator. This was the only connection in the whole reassembly that seemed to fight logic as the wire label didn’t logically aim away from the board like the rest of the wires. Logic failed us. Or maybe the other way around. After the fix, it was smooth sailing till the end. Both Adam and I have built our own desktops in the past and so had a collective knowledge decent enough to complete the exercise. We did a nice job working through the disassembly and reassembly taking turns nonchalantly disconnecting and reconnecting components all the while having a fun time and getting it done in a timely manner. This lab provided us not just a hands-on reinforcement of the last chapters, but also a means of getting comfortable working with a partner and relying on them. And we had fun doing it. Bonus! Difficulties we faced/how we overcame them Labs are perfect for learning from your failures and doing so promptly without catastrophic consequences. We did make a few mistakes, but luckily they were pretty minimal. We connected a few cables in the wrong direction, and we did not lock the pegs of the CPU fan into place during installation. The two cables that we connected incorrectly were the case power light cable, and the serial cable. In both of these cases there was a visual cue on the cable that allowed us to correctly orient them when we went back to fix it Had we slowed down during the lab, we probably would have made fewer mistakes. We could have checked and rechecked ourselves and made it perfect, but instead, we not only eventually made it perfect, but learned how to commit to a deadline, accept and rectify our failures and move on as a team. Which not only can happen, but will happen and knowing how to do this effectively is paramount in all professions. That of course doesn’t mean that we won’t intend on it being perfect. How we tested our lab During the lab we tested our PC a few times using just a monitor. We performed our first test at the very beginning, right after we got our computer. Before we even started the disassembly, we wanted to test the status of the computer before we made any changes. This was mostly to avoid confusing any previous issues with problems that may be caused by us during the disassembly/assembly process. Fortunately the PC worked as expected when we turned it on, and we were able to start disassembling it. The second Time we tested our PC was toward the end of the lab, after the reassembly. We wanted to check that we correctly replaced all of the components and cables, and that nothing was damaged during reassembly. Simply speaking, we wanted to make sure that everything worked again. After turning on the computer, we were happy to see that it booted and displayed something on the monitor. During this test, we neglected to check the case lights on the front, but we were later told that we had connected the case wires to the motherboard incorrectly. Our third test was a duplicate of the second one. Finally it resulted in a successful boot, something on the monitor, and functional case lights. What we learned As mentioned before, we have both built computers outside of class, so we were pretty confident going into the lab. Despite our previous knowledge, there were a few things that we were unsure about. Anywhere we were unsure we made a mistake, but the mistakes provided the most opportunity for learning. When we installed the CPU fan, we pushed the pegs down without locking them into place. During the lab we had a small discussion about which direction the arrow was supposed to point. Because we were both unsure, we ended up installing the fan incorrectly. From our mistake we learned that the fan pegs are unlocked when the arrows are pointing inward. We also connected a couple of cables in the wrong orientation. The cables were not keyed, which contributed to our confusion, but it prevented us from breaking things. Both of the cables that we connected incorrectly have visual cues that indicate their direction. On the small 2-pin case wires the white wire connects to the negative pin, and on the serial wire, the red line indicates the side with the firs pin. Because we connected the wires incorrectly, we were able to reinforce the visual cues by fixing our mistake.

Once this was done, I recorded my VM’s IP address so I could check my ability to connect with it remotely with VPN + SSH and with FileZilla. Difficulties I Faced/How I Overcame Them My difficulties were many and varied. While the VPN software install was easy, my password was incorrect, preventing me from connecting with the ITC server. Eventually my password was reset and I was able to connect. Next was the vSphere web client. While I was a little worried that the directions in Step 8.3 asked me to do something I could not do (grayed-out \"Browse\" button), I kept going, figuring since the file name looked right, everything would be ok. Unfortunately the network autoconfig step failed, which prevented further steps. Eventually I got stuck with the \"install sudo\" step since I had no network connection. I came in on Friday morning and asked Tom to let me into B-109 so I could work on this some more. He suggested that I simply start over the install, so we went into BIOS, switch the boot order to CD first, and proceeded with the re-install. This time there were no problems with the install. When I tried to test the remote connection via SSH, I initially failed because I had powered down the VM. Once it was back up, I still could not get in. However, I was using \"j.gower\" instead of \"jason\" for my user name - d’oh! My final problem was with changing my password on the ITC server. Specifically, Ctrl + Alt + Del did not give me a \"Change password\" option. Eventually I tried Ctrl + Alt + End and I did get the option, so was able to change my password. How I Tested My Lab I tested the VPN software by simply activating the software and entering my credentials (once I had the correct credentials). I got a message saying I was connected, but there was no install yet, so that’s all I could do at that point. Similarly, vSphere accepted my login credentials, so they were correct. The install itself was tested by powering down the VM and powering it back on. Sure enough, my screen showed a login so the install took. Next I checked the sudo install when I attempted to discover the VM’s IP address with ifconfig. I then checked that IP address by using VPN + SSH to make a remote connection from home, which worked. This was further checked by using FileZilla to SFTP in and see what little I have in my home directory. What I Learned I had never really used a VPN before, but no biggie — it’s just an application that I need to have up and running before I can remotely access my VM. I also have never used a VM, but again, no biggie — once we have the install, I’ll SSH in and won’t really notice the difference between being on a VM or just a remote machine. I had used Telnet/SSH many years ago, so nothing new there, either. What I did learn is how easy it is to install Debian, at least in a very basic configuration. I had heard stories in the past that Debian was harder to get into than some of the other distros. Or maybe I’m confusing Debian with Slackware?) In any case, it was so easy, I think I’ll install it on an old laptop and run through the labs on it, just to get additional practice. Finally, I had never worked with FileZilla before. In the past, I would just use a browser and enter in \"sftp://…​\". So I learned how cool FileZilla is — it’s very nice to have the two views, one for my local machine file system and one for the remote machine’s file system. Cool!

After, we set up the different interfaces on the routers and made sure the connections were working as expected. Our next task was configuring OSPF routing on the network, and after a few hiccups in the configuration we were able to continue to configure the PC’s and verify the overall connection of our network using OSPF. Part 2: We added passwords for logging in, the enable class, telnet, and ssh in this section, as well as configuring the SSH server on the routers. Then we preceded to encrypt all of the passwords being used so they were no longer a security risk in a real setting, as well as add a MOTD warning banner. After we made sure SSH was working, we experimented with using SCP and configuring the server for it on a router so that the configuration file of Router 1 could be saved to flash memory and copied over to Router 3. Part 3: The next section had us making many administrative roles in the routers, varying from the main admin to an assistant admin, and even a technician. We then altered all of the roles with custom rule sets on the commands they could operate with and messed around in all of them to see the limited set up. Part 4: This section had us secure different boot files so they could not be viewed from within the router unless a user had privileges to make them no longer secure. Followed by configuring SNMP Security on the network. This included setting up a standard access list to add the SNMP view to, and then make a group and user to allow it to be used. The next part of the section was using a router as a synchronized clock for the network using NTP on our network. The last part of the section was configuring Syslog on the router and installing a Syslog Server and enabling it. Part 5: We then configured a key chain on the three routers using the SHA256 encryption. Then we applied the OSPF key-chain to all of the interfaces that called for it, and again verified it was all working. Part 6: This last section was fairly straight forward and we used AutoSexure Cisco feature to secure the router with only a few prompts for us the fill in. The interesting part of the section was comparing the configuration it came up with the one pulled off R1 by R3 using SCP. Issues We Faced/How We Overcame Them While cabling our lab we ran into a few issues, our PCs were plugged into the wrong switch ports which resulted in not being able to ping our default gateways. This turned out to be an easy fix, however we had to do a fair amount of troubleshooting to figure out the issue. Obviously within the OSI model, we should have defaulted to looking at our physical hardware as a starting point for troubleshooting this issue. After fixing that issue, we had a difficult time getting OSPF configured on router 3. We did our due diligence and double checked our static routes, however we still couldn’t so a show ip ospf neighbor. What we ended up realizing, after a little assistance from Ben, was that OSPF was configured with the same routes on all three routers. After modifying our configs, we had OSPF up and running, and were able to ping each other’s PCs. The last major roadblock we encountered was after enabling OSPF authentication using SHA256. After inputting the show ip ospf neighbor command we still weren’t getting our routes to show up so we turned our attention to R2. After digging through the output of a sh run on R2 we determined that we never set up OSPF authentication on R2. After plugging in our authentication key commands we saw confirmation messages on both R1 and R3. How We Tested Our Lab Part 1: To test OSPF we used show ip ospf neighbor to view from each router what they could see as their neighbors. We looked for the addresses of the other networks we knew should be able to be seen and were able to troubleshoot the configuration until each router’s return of the command was what we wanted. Show ip route was also used to verify the connections made by the routers. And the final bit of testing was making sure R1 could ping R3, and PC-A could ping PC-C. Part 2: To test the minimum password we made sure one with less characters returned an error message. After making all the passwords and encrypting them, we used show run to go back and view them and make sure they appeared encrypted in the configuration file. Then to make sure the passwords were working as intended we logged out of the routers and then logged back in making sure the passwords were applied correctly, and we did the same thing for the SSH and telnet connections. Making sure the passwords we included were functioning as intended and encrypted. We also tested our password fail retry policy and attempts made to make sure it was also function. Testing the SCP server was done by completing the task of pulling the R1 configuration file from it to R3, and when that was done and we verified the file was good to go we knew that section was done. Part 3: To test the administrative roles we created, after making each one we entered into the view using parser view X and made sure the password assigned to was working correctly, and that it could not preform any of the commands that were not alotted to it. To do this we tested commands that shouldn’t work and they did not. And we made sure commands that were able to work did. Part 4: To verify the image and configuration files were secured, we made sure they did not appear in the flash read out after being secured. And that they were again visible after being unsecured. To test the SNMP security, we used show snmp group to view the configurations we made and to verify they looked as they should. And the show snmp user command to make sure the user was configured correctly as well. To make sure the NTP and clock was working we used the show clock to verify the times between all the routers were done correctly. The debug ntp all command to make sure the messages between the routers were coming and going. Part 5: After configuring the key-chain and OSPF configuration again, we used show ip ospf neighbor to verify the routers could see the ones neighboring them, as well as show ip route to make sure the routers have all of the connections they should. Part 6: This was tested by just making the new configuration had been implemented correctly by AutoSecure and looked at the differences between it and the one that had been loaded over from R1. What We Learned In this lab we learned a few things about securing our routers. Part 1 and Part 2 were mainly set up for the rest of the lab, and mostly review. In Part 3 we started learning about securing our routers and maintaining control over those accessing the router. We configured multiple different role views that had varying levels of privileges. This is a very important step in maintaining control of the network. Our goal is always to be using the principle of least privilege. There is no reason that a level 1 network technician should be messing with routing protocols, but it might be beneficial for them to view them. This is a very good way to make sure these privileges are separate. In Part 4 we learned about Cisco IOS Resilience which is a good way of making sure our routers are behaving properly using monitoring tools. Syslog is a great way of creating a timestamped log file to be later referenced. In Part 5 of this lab we learned about securing the control plane. Making sure the way our routers are communicating with each other does not change unless it should be a very important step in security. By setting up OSPF authentication we can prevent unauthorized access to modification of OSPF routes. Part 6 was interesting because on the face of it, required very little interacting from us. We answered a few questions and AutoSecure was able to provide us with a secure configuration for the router. While it’s important to make sure you know what kind of security and commands are applied to your router, AutoSecure seems like an equally beneficial way to go.

The purpose of the first lab was to configure a switched network with redundant links so that we could examine the process of determining a root bridge and see how STP selects ports based on cost or priority. The objective of the second lab configure a switched network to examine convergence in a PVST+ network versus Rapid PVST+ with PortFast and BPDU Guard. For both labs, we followed the instructions as outlined. Problems & Solutions We only had 1 problem while working through these 2 labs. We didn’t check that all of the switches had been reloaded properly. We incorrectly made the assumption that if the first was clear, then the rest would be, too. This became a problem when we checked the VLANs we’d created and noticed there were a few there that we had not created. Since we’d already configured quite a bit, we decided to use the no vlan command to remove the unwanted VLANs from the database so we didn’t have to delete vlan.dat and reload the switch. Once we had all the VLANs matching on the three switches, we were able to verify connectivity. How We Tested the Lab As usual, we tested the labs by making sure our output matched what was expected according to the lab instructions. For the first lab, we tested connectivity of switches after initial configuration and setup by using the ping command. After configuring STP, we used the show spanning-tree command to determine the root bridge, as well as the bridge priority and port roles on each switch. We used the same command to view STP changes after we changed the port cost on the blocked port, as well as when we viewed changes based on port priority. In the second lab, we didn’t verify anything until after configuring VLANs. We used the show vlan brief command to check that we’d configured the correct VLANs ad assigned the required ports. (This is where we noticed that one of the switches had not been properly reloaded by the last user.) We checked trunk interfaces by using the show interfaces trunk command. We also verified all the other configuration settings we made by using the show running-config command. Then we tested connectivity of our configuration with a ping from PC-A to PC-B. We used the debug spanning-tree events to watch the process of convergence happening after we shutdown a port. (We used no debug spanning-tree events to turn it off.) We used the same commands to view convergence with PVST+ and Rapid PVST+ configurations. All of our tests with both labs were successful. What We Learned In the first lab, we learned there are several numbers that can affect the election of the root bridge in STP. First, the switches look to the priority number (or combination of priority number and vlan id). If the priority is equal, then the switches will use the lowest MAC address. In order to determine port roles, switches look at the port cost for each port involved. Because defaults might lead to sub-optimal network switching, both the priority and port cost can be configured by an administrator. Finally, if port cost and bridge IDs are equal, port roles are determined by the port number, with the lowest port number taking priority. In the second lab, we learned about PVST+ and Rapid PVST+. The default setting for spanning-tree mode on Cisco switches is PVST+. We learned how to configure a primary and secondary root bridge using the spanning-tree vlan root primary and spanning-tree vlan root secondary commands. While using a debug command to watch network convergence, we learned that Rapid PVST+ converges noticeably quicker that PVST+. Using PortFast helps with faster convergence, because it allows configured ports to go directly into forwarding mode, rather than cycling through all the steps to get there. Additionally, BPDU Guard helps protect a port by shutting it down if it receives a BPDU packet (which is not the expectation on a port where it is enabled), allowing time for an administrator to check and see if some topology change happened which would require re-configuration of the port. Overall, we learned there are several configuration factors that can be set to influence traffic patterns on a network.

If labs in this class are done in groups you should turn in a single lab report for each lab completed. If labs are individual you will need to turn in your own lab report which is unique to you. Lab reports should be typed and should include the following information: Lab group members (only names on the report for a lab will receive credit for it, also do not list someone who did not actually work on the lab that is cheating) Course and section number Lab number and title A detailed description of what you did for the lab in your own words A detailed description of any problems or difficulties you encountered with the lab as well as how you solved them A description of how you tested your lab and what the results were A description of what new material or skills you learned in this lab See detailed information about some of these sections below. Please be as detailed as possible. Remember, points will be awarded based on the information on this report. The less information included the fewer opportunities for the instructor to award points. Lab reports serve multiple purposes including getting you to think critically about what you’ve just done (metacognition) as well as to provide evidence that you were able to successfully complete the lab. Showing that you are thinking critically about the lab is a good way to score highly on lab reports. If there is evidence that you did not actually complete the lab yourself you may receive a zero on the lab report even if the submitted report is well written. Instead of asking you to complete questions found in lab books you will create a narrative report on the lab in much the same format you might do in a science or other lab-based course. The advantages of this format is that you will do better quality lab work, get a better understanding of the lab concepts, and have an opportunity to practice valuable technical writing soft-skills. We have developed a lab report format which focuses on four key areas for reflection. These areas are: a description of what you did, what difficulties you had and how you overcame those difficulties, a description of how you tested the lab and a look back on what you learned from the lab. Significant thought was given to selecting these as the key areas for the reports and below are some thoughts about the what the intended purpose and outcome of each area is. The purpose of this section is to engage you in a metacognitive exercise thinking about what they did in this particular lab. Particularly in the case of highly prescriptive, step-oriented, labs students often will go through them following the directions but have no idea at the end about what they just did at a broader level and why it is an important thing to learn. In this section we’re looking for a description of the lab in your own words. At a higher level of evaluation we’re looking for evidence that you are aware of how this lab fits into the content of the course as a whole and into the IT field. In the grading of lab reports we often give less emphasis to this area as it’s intended more to force you to think about what they have done. We want you to think about that but we already know what you did, or at least what you were supposed to do so it’s less important from a grading perspective. The purpose of this section is to assist us in determining what the “hard parts” of the lab were for you and to confirm that you were able to work through them or that you need additional reinforcement on these concepts. An added benefit here is that you need to think though what your troubleshooting process was and ideally what additional efficiencies might be gained or what worked well in that process. This is a critical area from a grading perspective. We can gain significant insight into how the lab worked out for you and what the learning process was for you by reading this section. Particularly in labs which are less step-by-step in nature you may often think “are we done with this lab?”. This section requires students think about what it means to have been successful in completing the lab. Just as in the workplace students need to know when they can move on to another project or if there is more to do. We want to get you used to checking to make sure things are working as they expect after doing any system configuration or making a change as well as look to see that you did successfully complete the lab activity. In a similar way to the first section we want to force you to go though the process of thinking about testing the lab but it’s not critical from a grading perspective so we generally weight this section somewhat less than the others. You should be extremely thorough in this section. Every new concept or command that is introduced in the lab should be thoroughly tested and the testing documented in the report. Many times the lab instructions themselves do '''not''' thoroughly test the technologies used in the lab. Part of doing the lab is to come up with a testing plan ''yourself'' and to document and carry out that testing. It is absolutely unacceptable to simply say that testing of the lab was done by following the instructions. This does not show you know anything about what is supposed to work at all. This is a high value section of the lab report. Fundamentally the purpose of labs is to teach you new skills and to have you practice those skills. This section forces you to think about what you got, or should have gotten, out of doing the lab exercise. Sometimes you may have a difficult time understanding why we do lab exercises and you don’t immediately see the value in doing them. Here the goal is to have you try and come up with a narrative about what new things you learned or what was reinforced by the exercise, which is of course the purpose of having you do it. Hopefully we can see evidence that it was a worthwhile activity for you and that you truly did engage in the learning process. Undoubtedly this is the most critical section for grading purposes. Just as you want to know that they accomplished something worthwhile we are fundamentally interested in knowing that you had a positive learning outcome as well. Below are some example lab reports posted by students. These are certainly not perfect lab reports but are meant to give you a starting point about what a lab report might look like. You should look at many of these, not just ones for your class, so that you have a good idea of what sort of thing is expected in your reports.

This page explains how the site works and how to make updates to the site. The site is comprised of static pages hosted on GitHub pages which are generated programmatically from AsciiDoc files using the Antora site generator. The complete source code for the site can be found in the itc-docs GitHub repository. A GitHub workflow exists which automatically runs the Antora site generator and then deploys the site to GitHub pages each time a push to any YYYY.MM branch is made. The code for this workflow is also in the same repository. If you do not have commit access to the itc-docs repository you will need to fork the repository on GitHub, download a copy, edit the files, upload to your forked repository, and then submit a pull request. It is strongly suggested that you setup the same Antora build workflow on your forked repository or run Antora locally to build and test your edits before submitting the pull request. If you do have commit access to the itc-docs repository you can update your local copy, make changes, commit, and push to GitHub as you would with any normal source repository. Update your local branch git pull Commit changes to all modified files with an short explanation of the changes git add -A git commit -m \"a short explanation of what has been changed\" Upload changes to the remote repository (assuming you have commit permission there) git push Antora is setup to automatically build multiple versions of the site based on the branches in Git that are identified by a branch name like YYYY.MM. The idea is that a new branch will be created from the main branch at the beginning of each semester in the YYYY.MM format. This branch will be used for changes made during that semester. At the end of the semester the changes will be merged back into the main branch. That way the final version of the site each semester will continue to be available as the latest commit of each branch. The YYYY.MM format was chosen as they will sort correctly to find the latest branch. For example at the beginning of Fall 2022 a branch 2022.08 will be created and at the beginning of Spring 2023 a branch 2023.01 will be created. Create a branch at the beginning of the semester and switch to that branch git pull git checkout -b \"YYYY.MM\" Upload changes to the new branch the first time by specifying it git push --set-upstream origin YYYY.MM At the end of the semester merge changes back into the main branch and upload it git checkout main git merge YYYY.MM git push As mentioned, the site uses AsciiDoc as the format for individual pages. The documentation for AsciiDoc is the first place to start if you want to know how to format something on a page. Because the site itself is built using the Antora program their documentation explains the heirarchy of directories and files, as well as some quirks to the AsciiDoc format specific to Antora. The easiest way is to click the \"Edit this Page\" link in the upper right corner of any page. This will take you to an edit screen showing the page source and location. However, unless you have commit access to the repository you will need to fork the repository and submit a pull request as described above in order to make a change on the live site. Antora organizes things into \"components\" which are parents to \"modules\". Each module can hold a number of pages, snippets (called partials), examples, images, and attachments. The idea is that the different components can be pulled from different Git repositories at build time and so can have different owners/permissions. Things can be linked or included between components and modules as needed. For this site the major sections of the site, including a separate section for each faculty member that wants one (so they can be pulled from individual repositories), are their oen components. Most components are only using a \"root\" module at this time as there are a relatively limited number of pages in most components. The notable exception to this is that faculty components are likely to be divided into a module for each course so that various course pages, lab activities, images, attachments, etc. can be held together. The design and layout of the site is controlled by the UI bundle which is part of the Antora playbook. A JavaScript based search capability has been added to the site using the Lunr module for Antora. This is included in the build process through the build workflow and enabled in the playbook.

This guide will give you some tips on troubleshooting phone registration. We will assume that the phone has power and is booting properly and that the phone is using an SCCP firmware image as opposed to a SIP image. During troubleshooting it is helpful to remember what happens during the phone boot process: . The phone receives power, either through PoE or from an external power supply as well as a network connection. . The phone received voice VLAN information from the switch using CDP. This puts the phone onto the correct VLAN which is important for the next step. . The phone makes a DHCP request (a broadcast) on whatever VLAN has been assigned. Assuming that a DHCP server is properly operating on that VLAN it sends back an IP address, mask, default gateway, and option 150 information which tells the phone what TFTP server to check with for the next step. . The phone makes a request to the TFTP server specified by option 150 in the DHCP reply. The exact filename(s) requested varies depending on the phone model and firmware and can be specific to a single phone or a generic file which applies to multiple phones. This file can contain information about what firmware version should be loaded/upgraded on the phone as well as the IP address of the Call Manager server to connect to in the next step and other basic device configuration settings. . The phone attempts to register with the IP address for the Call Manager server which has been delivered by TFTP. Each of these boot steps can potentially have a problem associated with it which would prevent the phone from registering and it makes sense to check each step for potential problems. With experience you can learn which step is most likely to be causing the problem based on the information you see but for now it’s probably best to work through each step in order. Make sure the phone has power to it, either from a PoE device such as a switch or from an external power supply. If you are using PoE some possibilities for problems could be the phone requesting more power than the switch has available, PoE not being turned on for the phone’s port, or using a non-PoE capable switch. Check your switch configuration and make sure that you have set a voice vlan on the port which the phone is connected to. Check the phone itself within the Settings → Network Configuration for a correct \"VLAN Id\" setting which the phone should be getting from the switch. Check to make sure that the Voice VLAN is allowed and active on the trunk link between your switch and router. If your Voice VLAN can’t be seen by the router it will not be able to provide DHCP addressing or CME services to the phone. Check to see if your phone is getting an IP address from your DHCP server. This is probably easiest done from the phone in the Settings → Network Configuration menu of the phone. You should have an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway coming from your DHCP server. If your phone appears to have correct IP addressing information make sure that you can route traffic to and from your phone. Try pinging from a PC on your lab network to the IP address of the phone and try opening a web browser to the IP address of your phone. These should be successful indicating correct layer 3 networking to the the phone. If you fail to make a connection to the IP address of the phone you have something entirely outside of the VoIP configuration not working, could be a routing problem, VLAN problem, switch problem, etc. but the problem is not specific to VoIP configuration. If your DHCP server is not directly connected to the Voice VLAN (if you’re running a DHCP server on the router, as is typical in the labs, this is not an issue) make sure that you have correct ip helper-address settings in place. Check to see that your phone is getting the correct TFTP server address from the DHCP server. Again, you should be able to find this on the phone in the Settings → Network Configuration menu. For our labs the correct TFTP server address will either be the address of the router interface which is setup as the ip source-address in your config-telephony setup (for CME labs) or the address of your CUCM server (for CUCM labs). This address should be set as a DHCP option 150 in your DHCP server configuration. Note, the address may not always be on the same VLAN/subnet as the Voice VLAN (especially when you get into CUCM labs), that is OK! As long as routing is working properly and the phone can reach the TFTP IP through it’s default gateway things will work fine. You can put a test device, like a computer, into the voice VLAN on a different port and make sure it gets a correct IP address in the Voice VLAN range and is able to ping the TFTP server address. Make sure that the TFTP configuration files were created on your router (the '''create-cnf files''' command) Try clearing the CTL/ITL security files from the phone. Even a \"factory reset\" of the phone will leave these files in place. The phone will not register to a new server unless these files are deleted which must be done from the phone itself. If you are running CME and have made it this far the most likely problem is a misconfiguration of your ephone settings on CME, an incorrect MAC address or something along those lines. If you can’t figure it out by looking at the config you can watch the registration process using the debug ephone detail command. Use undebug all to disable debugging mode. Note that by default debugging will only go to the local console port, if you are connected by telnet/SSH to the router you will need to enter the additional terminal monitor command to see debugging messages. Have you manually setup the phone or are you relying on auto registration? If you are using Auto Registration it’s likely you have run out of extensions in the auto registration range you have configured. Once an auto-registration DN is used it cannot be used again by another device (even if you later change the device to have a different DN). Try expanding your auto-registration range or deleting the unused DNs: To delete unused DNs: Go to Cisco Unified CM Administration Page > Call Routing > Route Plan Report. Click the Find button and look for DNs from your auto registration range which are currently unassigned. Check the check box next to the directory numbers you wish to delete and click Delete Selected. Confirm the deletion.

This is done in order to prevent a man-in-the-middle attack where someone gets phones to register to a fake server and can then monitor and tamper with all voice traffic. This also means that in a lab environment once a phone is connected to a specific CUCM server it will only register to that server unless you clear the Initial Trust List (ITL) and Certificate Trust List (CTL) files from the phone. This requires having physical access to the phone (well, there is actually one way to do it remotely with a password and some extra setup but that’s outside of the scope of this document). First, try clearing the network settings: . Press the Settings button and navigate to \"Network Settings\" but do not enter the submenu. . Unlock the configuration menu by pressing \"* * #\" on the phone. If you see a small padlock in the upper right corner of the screen it will switch to an unlocked padlock. . Press the Erase softkey (the buttons along the bottom of the screen). If you don’t see Erase you may need to press More one or more times to get to a screen which has Erase. . The phone should reset with cleared network settings. Next, try clearing the ITL file: On the 79xx series phones: Press the Settings button and navigate to and enter the Security > Trust List > ITL File submenu. Unlock the configuration if it is not currently unlocked (look at the padlock in the upper right corner) by pressing \"* * #\" on the phone. The small padlock in the upper right corner of the screen it will switch to an unlocked padlock. Press the Erase softkey (the buttons along the bottom of the screen). If you don’t see Erase you may need to press More one or more times to get to a screen which has Erase. The phone should reset with an empty ITL file. On the 89xx/99xx series phones: Press the Settings button and navigate to and enter the Administrator Settings > Reset Settings > Security Settings option. The phone should reset with an empty ITL file.
