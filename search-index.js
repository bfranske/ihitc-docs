Hills Community College will grant credit equivalencies to many Information Technology & Careers (ITC, CS) courses based on certification exam results indicating a passing score which meet the following criteria: . Exam is administered by Pearson VUE, Thomson/Prometric, Certiport or a future authorized industry certification testing company. Certification results are confirmed directly from certifying agent (e.g., Cisco, Microsoft, CompTIA) through mail, secure website or other means initiated by the certifying agent. The student is responsible for making arrangements to provide this documentation. . The certification exam is based on outcomes and objectives that correspond substantially to the content being taught in current courses. In cases where the current course content is based on technology that is substantially different from the certification exam taken by the student, credit will not be granted. Students my retake exams to qualify for credit equivalency. . In the case of certifications with expiration dates the certification is not expired. In the case of individual exams or certifications without expiration dates the exam taken is the most current version. Due to constantly evolving industry certifications specific exams are no longer listed in the course catalog with course equivalencies. A faculty member from the ITC department will review all credit equivalencies for ITC courses and determine whether the exam taken or certification obtained substantially corresponds to the course. A general guideline of common course equivalencies can be found on the ITC department website or by contacting one of the ITC instructors. Examples of certifications commonly accepted for course credit include the CompTIA A+, Cisco CCNA, CCNA Specializations, CCNP, Microsoft MCITP and Microsoft Office Specialist tracks. The table below is a general guideline of common course equivalencies and does not assure the academic credit will be granted for specific exams. Exams vary in content and structure over time and may not measure the current outcomes and objectives of a course; in such cases, credit cannot be given for current courses. A faculty member from the ITC department will review all credit equivalencies for ITC courses and determine whether the exam taken or certification obtained substantially corresponds to the course.

Note the tabs at the bottom of the document for different degree programs. In determining the course sequence (and the schedule for our classes) we need to make some assumptions. It’s OK if you don’t match these assumptions but it will likely mean that you will need more than 4 semesters (2 years) to complete your degree. This depends on your specific situation. In any case we do not recommend taking any class before you have completed all of the prerequisites for the class. IT courses build on one another so you should finish any required prerequisite course listed before taking a class. We assume you start in the Fall semester. We do have some class options if you start in the Spring but you will likely have to wait for some classes too because we just don’t have enough students starting in the Spring to run a second copy of every course and, as noted above, IT courses tend to build on one another. If you start in the Spring it’s most likely that you will have some lighter semesters (fewer credits) but will probably take an extra semester to graduate. We assume you are a full-time student. This means you will be taking between 14-16 credits a semester. This is some pretty simple math, to do a 60 credit degree program (as most 2 year degrees are) you need to do an average of 60/4 = 15 credits per semester. Because there is a 4 credit writing class one semester will need to be 16 credits. If you are a full-time student we recommend you do not plan on working more than a few hours a week. Our courses cover a lot of material and we expect that if you are taking 15 credits of classes you are spending about 45 hours a week on classes/homework. That doesn’t leave a lot of time for outside employment. Many of our students do work while taking classes but if you are working an appreciable number of hours you should probably plan on being a part-time student and taking fewer classes per semester. These course sequences don’t show you exactly which classes to take when in that case, but can provide some useful suggestions about the general order you should take classes in and what semesters certain classes are offered. We assume you do not need to re-take any classes. Depending on what class it is this could throw you off the track of pre-requisites and that would mean one or two additional semesters before you can get the class you need to continue on your track so graduation will take one or two semesters longer. We assume you do not need to take remedial classes. If you are not yet ready for any of the classes on the sequence (e.g. you have not placed in to ENG 1108, or haven’t tested out of ITC-1200 and want to do the Network Technology & Security degree) that would be additional time beyond the sequence of classes we have laid out as those classes are not really part of the degree itself.

You can see that both the most important and most interesting parts of the chapter were clearly discusses as well as what the author thinks is the reason they are interesting and important. Questions related to the content of the chapter have been included making it easier for other students to respond to the posting. Most Important: It seemed like the most important topic covered by this chapter was an overview of security threats in section 1.2 (i.e. threat vectors, virus/trojan/worm/malware, hackers), the types of hackers (black/grey/white hat, hacktivists, state-sponsored), the types of tools they employ (password crackers, packet sniffers/crafters, rootkits to name a few), and the categories of attacks (eavesdropping, spoofing, DoS, man-in-the-middle, reconnaissance, etc) to give us an idea of how important security is in today’s networks and ways to potentially mitigate against those threats (as covered in section 1.3). Most Interesting: One interesting part of the chapter to me was the discussion of 'honeypot' servers and how Norse Dark Intelligence purposefully deploys these decoy servers and study how hackers attempt to breach their security. Afterward, they provide the information to organizations for examination allowing them to come up with countermeasures against it. Similarly, Cisco provides information and mitigation techniques against current attacks on their Cisco Security Intelligence Operations (SIO) site for network administrators. Another interesting part of the chapter to me was just how secure Data Center Networks are. Because of the amounts of sensitive business data they house, they are not only securely interconnected to corporate sites (e.g. via VPN/ASA devices) but also require many levels of physical security; Some examples include security officers, fences/gates, video surveillance, alarms, motion detectors, traps, and bio-metric access/exit (such as a badge ID to enter the trap and then facial/fingerprint recognition to enter and exit the data hall). Questions: How do they make a 'honeypot' server an attractive enough target for hackers? Do they leave certain vulnerabilities open on purpose, make them conspicuous enough, or are networks so routinely under attack that none of these measures are necessary? Also, when a virtual machine hosted on cloud computing that has outdated security (hasn’t been powered on in a long time for example) connects to the internet, would that be considered a threat vector to the rest of the network (like hyperjacking) or is the sand-boxed nature of virtual machines enough of a preventive measure? This post comes from an early chapter in the PC Hardware & Software class. It clearly describes what the author thought the most important and interesting parts of the chapter where and why as well as a couple of questions related to the content of the chapter. I personally thought the most important concept from chapter one was the compatibility of components. For example processors manufactured by AMD have a physically different design to those manufactured by Intel. So, If a technician is building a computer, they must select a CPU that is compatible with the motherboard they have chosen. This is important because incompatibility can cause a computer to fail, even if all the components are operational. I thought the most interesting section of the chapter was the one about the differing ports and cables. Before this reading I was only familiar with the most common types of ports/cables like DVI, HDMI, USB, etc. I had heard the name of some of the other types of ports/cables, but I did not know what they were used for or how they compared to each other. I now understand each type of port/cable, and its function. I was wondering generally how long it took for new technologies to be adopted by the public. Also, why has USB persisted if thunderbolt has been so much faster for much longer?

You will be graded based on your participation in the online discussion and the quality of your posts and interaction with others online. As with many classes there is typically a three-post minimum for each chapter to be considered as participating. In all cases though you are better served by posting more and quality is just as important as quantity. In fact, you can get full points even with less than three posts if your posts are extremely high quality, substantially contribute to the discussion, and aid in assisting other members of the course understand the material. While only 3 posts are generally required, if you are more active in the forum than that and helping people you can earn additional points (up to the maximum for each topic) for additional response posts so if you forget the initial post or some of your posts are not quite high enough quality to earn all the points typically given for that post type you could still potentially earn all of the points by being active and helpful with more posts. When grading posts the biggest factor in getting a good score is how much new and unique information you have contributed to the discussion. This is why simply agreeing with someone else about what they thought was important or interesting will likely not earn you any points for that post no matter how long of a post it is. This means you can write an entire page of text but if it basically summarizes to \"I agree with you\" or \"I found what you posted helpful\" it’s not worth anything. Normally though a longer, more detailed, post will get a higher score than a shorter post. Also, inclusion of helpful outside materials (links to relevant articles, YouTube videos, etc.) is helpful in raising the score on your post though it should be clear you didn’t just do a search and added some links you should have read and reviewed the video/links and speak as to the specific content or way each might be helpful. Be sure to talk about and integrate the outside information into your post though and not just spam a bunch of links, that wouldn’t really be contributing any of your own thoughts and doesn’t show you have read the article or given much thought to it. Under no circumstances can forum posts be turned in late (after the response posts are due for a chapter). Because forum postings require a back-and-forth between multiple members of the class it is simply not possible to accept these late under any circumstances. You can always still try to get all the points even if you miss the first post by being exceptionally active and high quality in your response posts (making many more than the minimum and high in quality) but after the due date for the response posts there is no guarantee you will be able to make these up in any way. See below for some specific details about how each type of post should be handled. I do not generally grade on grammar but if your poor grammar makes it difficult or impossible to understand what you are trying to say or you break other rules below you can absolutely receive a zero on a post (or even many posts). The first post you make for each chapter is typically the longest and most detailed. It should include a brief discussion of what you thought the most important parts of the chapter were and why they are important for you to know, what you thought the most interesting parts were and why you found them interesting, and at least one question related either directly to the readings or the general topic covered in the readings. If forum posts for each chapter/topic in the course are worth a total of 10 points (this varies a bit from class to class) you can usually earn up to 5 points for this initial post. DO: Separate your post into at least three paragraphs/headings: \"Most Important\", \"Most Interesting\", and \"Questions\" Pick one specific thing from the chapter that was the most interesting to you and talk about why it is so interesting to you. Use at the very minimum three sentences to explain this. It’s pretty easy to get to five sentences if you’re doing a good job explaining why you think this the most interesting thing. Pick one specific thing from the chapter that you think was the most important and talk about why you think it is so important for you to know. Use at the very minimum three sentences to explain this. It’s pretty easy to get to five sentences if you’re doing a good job explaining why you think this the most important thing. End with one or two questions about something related to the chapter. They could be something you didn’t quite understand from the chapter or they could be something related to a topic from the chapter but not specifically covered. Ensure your question(s) are clear to others and if someone responds back to you about them you should give them some feedback about their answer, ask for more clarification, etc. Make sure that your post is clearly and thoroughly communicating the ideas you want to share following general English grammar and writing rules. Use complete sentences to express your thoughts. Relate the topic to yourself. Think about things you may need to do in the future and what would be important or interesting to know and why it would be important for you to know or interesting to you. DO NOT: Summarize the entire chapter/module/topic Say that everything was important or just repeat the name of the chapter/module/topic as important Say that everything was interesting or just repeat the name of the chapter/module/topic as interesting Post something which is not easily understood by another person (related to the grammar of the post) Forget to explain why you found things important to know or interesting to you. Think about things you may need to do in the future and what would be important or interesting to know. Use any kind of automatic summarization tools or have anyone else summarize for you. (see the academic integrity section of the syllabus) Turn in someone else’s work (see the academic integrity section of the syllabus) Skip writing 1-2 questions for other people to respond to because you \"understood everything\". It’s great if you understood everything but then you should have questions about the topic which were not covered in the readings that you are wondering about. After you make your initial post you should continue to contribute to the forum by regularly reading the postings of other class members and responding as appropriate. Particularly, try to assist in answering their questions, pointing them to additional related resources you found helpful including YouTube videos, other sites, locations in the readings, etc. These posts should be much more than just agreeing with what someone else stated or saying that you found their post helpful. You need to substantially contribute and add new information to an ongoing discussion about the topic in order to be considered as participating. Simple agreement posts will not be worth any points. If forum posts for each chapter/topic in the course are worth a total of 10 points (this varies a bit from class to class) you can usually earn up to 2-3 points for each response post. DO: Try to answer questions that people have posed Try to do some research on people’s questions instead of just providing an opinion without any support Include links to outside resources such as reputable websites, videos, etc. Try to be helpful or ask for help if you are having a problem with a related lab activity or anything else related to the topic. Post more times than the minimum required if you want to be sure to get all the points. Respond thoroughly and clearly. To clearly communicate an idea in less than 3-5 sentences is very difficult in most cases. Use complete sentences to express your thoughts. DO NOT: Post links without any of your own description/details/how you found them helpful. You need to review the material you’re linking to and talk about it in your response post too. Just agree with other people or provide posts with minimal useful contribution to the discussion Expect points just for posting, you need to follow the rules and be really contributing to helping other people in order to get points Be too brief with your post to be useful Sample First Posts Sample Response Posts Document Build Time: 2022-08-17 13:56:12 -0500 Page Version: 2022.08 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License","title":"Franske Forum Posting Format","component":"franske-courses","version":"2022.08","name":"index","url":"/franske-courses/current/forum-posting/","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"First Post","hash":"_first_post","id":2},{"text":"Response Posts","hash":"_response_posts","id":3},{"text":"Sample Forum Posts","hash":"_sample_forum_posts","id":4}]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"You are responsible for completing ALL of these labs.

You will be responsible for completing required readings in the textbook or online, watching tutorial videos, listening to recorded podcasts, completing labs in the IHCC virtual lab environment, participating in online discussions, and completing online exams. Grades will be determined by performance on unit multiple-choice tests, lab exercises, participation, a skills exam, and a final exam. A description of assignments and directions for assignments are available from the course website. It is expected that assignments will be completed and turned in on time and as specified. Failure to turn in one or more assignments without approval from the instructor may result in an additional lack of participation penalty of up to 20% of your course grade depending on the type of the assignment. If assignments are turned in late 10% will be deducted for each day or partial day the assignment is late. If you are turning in an assignment late you must contact the instructor for information before the due date. Failure to do so may result in additional penalties. The grading of late assignments is given a lower priority and may take longer so students are encouraged to plan ahead and turn in assignments on time. Penalty-free deadline extensions will not be given without written documentation from a licensed medical practitioner or other extenuating circumstances at the discretion of the instructor. Letter Grade Percentage Range Description A 100%-90% achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements B 89%-80% achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet course requirements C 79%-70% achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect D 69%-65% achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully the course requirements F 64%-0% Represents failure and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) N Represents no credit and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) I Represents incomplete and is assigned at the discretion of the instructor when, due to extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student is prevented from completing the work of the course on time. Requires a written agreement between instructor and student. Students must request an incomplete from the instructor. Grades for this course are calculated based on a weighted points system. Each assignment, quiz or test is assigned to one of the weighted categories below and is graded on a points system. Your percentage is calculated for each category by dividing the points earned in that category by the points available. Finally, your percentage earned in each category is multiplied by the weight of that category and these are added together. The instructor may round up based on student participation and individual improvement. Category Percent of Final Grade Topic Assessments 20% Lab Assignments 30% Written Final Exam 15% Skills Based Final Exam 15% Homework, Activities & Participation 20% Mid-Term grades are not officially distributed but assignment scores are made available in the online grade book as assignments are graded and you may calculate your current course grade at any time using the above instructions and weighting. It is strongly suggested that if you want to know where you stand in the class you re-create your own copy of the gradebook with appropriate weights in a spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets where you can estimate scores you will likely get on future assignments and run other \"what-if\" scenarios. Be aware that the final grade in online gradebooks may be calculated in a way which ignores any assignments you have not turned in. At the end of the semester assignments which have not been turned in will have scores of 0 recorded in the gradebook. If you have missing assignments this may cause your grade to suddenly drop from what was previously shown. It is your responsibility to know what assignments you have not completed, that those will become 0s if not turned in, and how that will affect your grade. === Extra Credit Students should not rely on extra credit to boost their grade and should instead complete each assignment to the best of their ability. However, from time to time extra credit opportunities may arise at which time they will be announced in class, by email and/or through the course website. Extra credit will be added to the Homework, Activities & Participation category. After the first class meeting formal attendance will not be taken; however, students are expected to arrive to class on time and participate in class. Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled. If attendance is a problem participation assignments may be given and included in the course grade. If an illness or emergency results in an absence, students should contact their instructors as soon as possible to determine if missed work can be completed. A student may receive a course grade of FN or NC after two consecutive weeks of unexcused absence at any time during the semester. Class attendance is defined as being physically present in the classroom. Online attendance is defined as having submitted an assignment, taken a quiz, or posted/made a course content-related comment on the discussion/chat board for the course in which the student is registered. You will need daily access to a high-speed internet connection (DSL, cable modem, 4G, fiber, or equivalent) and a modern computer to successfully complete this course. Academic integrity is one of the most important values in higher education. This principle requires that each student’s work represents his or her own personal efforts and that the student acknowledges the intellectual contributions of others. The foundation for this principle is student academic honesty. IHCC students are expected to honor the requirements of the College Academic Integrity Policy.

You will be responsible for completing required readings in the textbook or online, watching tutorial videos, listening to recorded podcasts, completing labs in the IHCC virtual lab environment, participating in online discussions, and completing online exams. Grades will be determined by performance on unit multiple-choice tests, lab exercises, participation, a skills exam, and a final exam. A description of assignments and directions for assignments are available from the course website. It is expected that assignments will be completed and turned in on time and as specified. Failure to turn in one or more assignments without approval from the instructor may result in an additional lack of participation penalty of up to 20% of your course grade depending on the type of the assignment. If assignments are turned in late 10% will be deducted for each day or partial day the assignment is late. If you are turning in an assignment late you must contact the instructor for information before the due date. Failure to do so may result in additional penalties. The grading of late assignments is given a lower priority and may take longer so students are encouraged to plan ahead and turn in assignments on time. Penalty-free deadline extensions will not be given without written documentation from a licensed medical practitioner or other extenuating circumstances at the discretion of the instructor. Letter Grade Percentage Range Description A 100%-90% achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements B 89%-80% achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet course requirements C 79%-70% achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect D 69%-65% achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully the course requirements F 64%-0% Represents failure and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) N Represents no credit and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) I Represents incomplete and is assigned at the discretion of the instructor when, due to extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student is prevented from completing the work of the course on time. Requires a written agreement between instructor and student. Students must request an incomplete from the instructor. Grades for this course are calculated based on a weighted points system. Each assignment, quiz or test is assigned to one of the weighted categories below and is graded on a points system. Your percentage is calculated for each category by dividing the points earned in that category by the points available. Finally, your percentage earned in each category is multiplied by the weight of that category and these are added together. The instructor may round up based on student participation and individual improvement. Category Percent of Final Grade Topic Assessments 20% Lab Assignments 30% Written Final Exam 15% Skills Based Final Exam 15% Homework, Activities & Participation 20% Mid-Term grades are not officially distributed but assignment scores are made available in the online grade book as assignments are graded and you may calculate your current course grade at any time using the above instructions and weighting. It is strongly suggested that if you want to know where you stand in the class you re-create your own copy of the gradebook with appropriate weights in a spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets where you can estimate scores you will likely get on future assignments and run other \"what-if\" scenarios. Be aware that the final grade in online gradebooks may be calculated in a way which ignores any assignments you have not turned in. At the end of the semester assignments which have not been turned in will have scores of 0 recorded in the gradebook. If you have missing assignments this may cause your grade to suddenly drop from what was previously shown. It is your responsibility to know what assignments you have not completed, that those will become 0s if not turned in, and how that will affect your grade. === Extra Credit Students should not rely on extra credit to boost their grade and should instead complete each assignment to the best of their ability. However, from time to time extra credit opportunities may arise at which time they will be announced in class, by email and/or through the course website. Extra credit will be added to the Homework, Activities & Participation category. After the first class meeting formal attendance will not be taken; however, students are expected to arrive to class on time and participate in class. Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled. If attendance is a problem participation assignments may be given and included in the course grade. If an illness or emergency results in an absence, students should contact their instructors as soon as possible to determine if missed work can be completed. A student may receive a course grade of FN or NC after two consecutive weeks of unexcused absence at any time during the semester. Class attendance is defined as being physically present in the classroom. Online attendance is defined as having submitted an assignment, taken a quiz, or posted/made a course content-related comment on the discussion/chat board for the course in which the student is registered. You will need daily access to a high-speed internet connection (DSL, cable modem, 4G, fiber, or equivalent) and a modern computer to successfully complete this course. Academic integrity is one of the most important values in higher education. This principle requires that each student’s work represents his or her own personal efforts and that the student acknowledges the intellectual contributions of others. The foundation for this principle is student academic honesty. IHCC students are expected to honor the requirements of the College Academic Integrity Policy. The following are some examples of unacceptable academic practices that will be viewed as policy violations. It is unacceptable to submit the work of another person as your own. If you quote, summarize, paraphrase, or use the ideas of another, you must accurately attribute that information. If you do not acknowledge the source, you are plagiarizing. Academic dishonesty also includes unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting the same assignment for multiple classes without instructor permission; taking an examination for another person and many other situations. If you are unsure whether you are plagiarizing or how to cite a source please ask an instructor or staff member for help prior to turning in the assignment. In this course, the first offense of plagiarism and/or cheating will result in a score of zero on the assignment, quiz or test and reporting of the incident to college administration. Further plagiarism and/or cheating may result in immediate failure of the course and additional consequences determined by college administration. If you have cheated in other ITC courses that will count as your first offense. In other words, if you have cheated in ITC courses before cheating in this course may result in immediately failing the course and additional consequences determined by college administration.

This means that you and your lab partner will be meeting regularly with the instructor during the on campus course time to assess your progress unless you have received special permission from the instructor. Additional details about this are available on the course website. Grades will be determined by performance on unit multiple-choice tests, lab exercises, participation, a skills exam, and a final exam. A description of assignments is available from the course website. It is expected that assignments will be completed and turned in on time and as specified. Failure to turn in one or more assignments without approval from the instructor may result in an additional lack of participation penalty of up to 20% of your overall course grade depending on the type of the assignment. If assignments are turned in late 10% will be deducted for each day or partial day the assignment is late. If you are turning in an assignment late you must contact the instructor for information before the due date. Failure to do so may result in additional penalties. The grading of late assignments is given a lower priority and may take longer so students are encouraged to plan ahead and turn in assignments on time. Penalty-free deadline extensions will not be given without written documentation from a licensed medical practitioner or other extenuating circumstances at the discretion of the instructor. If you miss or do poorly on a regular unit/module/chapter exam (not a final exam or skills final exam) you may petition the instructor to retake the exam once. You will need to write a 400-500 word summary of the unit/module/chapter which is covered by the exam. This summary must be written by you personally, the use of any automatic summarization tools or summaries by others will be considered cheating on the exam and is subject to the academic integrity policies covered elsewhere. Your summary must also be written to the satisfaction of the instructor. Retakes or make-ups must be completed by the date specified by the instructor. There is generally no additional late penalty for an exam retake other than needing to write and submit the summary. Letter Grade Percentage Range Description A 100%-90% achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements B 89%-80% achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet course requirements C 79%-70% achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect D 69%-65% achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully the course requirements F 64%-0% Represents failure and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) N Represents no credit and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) I Represents incomplete and is assigned at the discretion of the instructor when, due to extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student is prevented from completing the work of the course on time. Requires a written agreement between instructor and student. Students must request an incomplete from the instructor. This course is a combination of two Cisco Networking Academy courses, CCNA 1 and CCNA 2. Grades for each of these two courses will be calculated separately following the method below and then the two courses will be averaged for a final grade in the single 6 credit college course. Grades for each course is calculated based on a weighted points system. Each assignment, quiz or test is assigned to one of the weighted categories below and is graded on a points system. Your percentage is calculated for each category by dividing the points earned in that category by the points available. Finally, your percentage earned in each category is multiplied by the weight of that category and these are added together. The instructor may round up based on student participation and individual improvement. Category Percent of Final Grade Unit Assessments 20% Lab/Homework Assignments 35% Regular Final Exam 15% Skills Based Final Exam 15% Participation Activities 15% Detailed information about assignments and which category they are included in is on the \"Assignments\" page of the course website. Mid-Term grades are not officially distributed but assignment scores are made available in the online grade book as assignments are graded and you may calculate your current course grade at any time using the above instructions and weighting. It is strongly suggested that if you want to know where you stand in the class you re-create your own copy of the gradebook with appropriate weights in a spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets where you can estimate scores you will likely get on future assignments and run other \"what-if\" scenarios. Be aware that the final grade in online gradebooks may be calculated in a way which ignores any assignments you have not turned in. At the end of the semester assignments which have not been turned in will have scores of 0 recorded in the gradebook. If you have missing assignments this may cause your grade to suddenly drop from what was previously shown. It is your responsibility to know what assignments you have not completed, that those will become 0s if not turned in, and how that will affect your grade. Students should not rely on extra credit to boost their grade and should instead complete each assignment to the best of their ability. However, from time to time extra credit opportunities may arise at which time they will be announced in class, by email and/or through the course website. Unless otherwise noted extra credit will be added to the Lab/Homework Assignments category. It is unacceptable to look for or find copies of exams, exam questions, or scenarios online and use them to complete your exam. Answering a question or scenario incorrectly based on the exam you are taking but in a way that was indicated as correct on a version of the exam which was found online will be seen as evidence of intentional cheating. You will receive a penalty and it will be reported as indicated in the course and campus policies section below. In plain English…​ I know some copies of exams for this course circulate online. I look at these and may modify the exam you are given so that a different answer is correct for what looks to be a similar question. You may call these \"trick questions\" but in this case they are only a trick question if you have seen a stolen copy of an old exam. If you answer one or more of these as shown on the stolen exam this will be evidence of cheating and you will be punished according to cheating policies. Do not cheat, do not look for or use stolen exams. See the course and campus policies section below for additional information on cheating policies. In the case of Packet Tracer activities this means you must start with the file provided by your instructor or as part of the curriculum and complete the activity yourself. You may of course ask others for help figuring something out but you must do the work yourself. Do not simply follow tutorials or videos from start to finish showing how to complete the activity as that will not allow you to learn the process and you will likely score poorly on lab exams. You may never ask anyone else to complete an activity for you or turn in an activity completed by someone else, this will be treated as cheating. In the case of lab activities which are designed to use physical lab equipment you must work on physical lab equipment, no simulators are allowed. Unless specific permission is given by the instructor this means you must use the IHCC lab equipment on campus or the IHCC Netlab remote lab system. Any evidence that you have turned in a lab report for a lab which is designed to be completed on physical equipment without using physical equipment will be treated as cheating. See the course and campus policies section below for additional information on cheating policies. After the first class meeting formal attendance will not be taken; however, students are expected to arrive to class on time and participate in class. Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled. If attendance is a problem participation assignments may be given and included in the course grade. If an illness or emergency results in an absence, students should contact their instructors as soon as possible to determine if missed work can be completed. A student may receive a course grade of FN or NC after two consecutive weeks of unexcused absence at any time during the semester. Class attendance is defined as being physically present in the classroom. Online attendance is defined as having submitted an assignment, taken a quiz, or posted/made a course content-related comment on the discussion/chat board for the course in which the student is registered. You will need daily access to a high-speed internet connection (DSL, cable modem, 4G, fiber, or equivalent) and a modern computer to successfully complete this course. Academic integrity is one of the most important values in higher education. This principle requires that each student’s work represents his or her own personal efforts and that the student acknowledges the intellectual contributions of others. The foundation for this principle is student academic honesty. IHCC students are expected to honor the requirements of the College Academic Integrity Policy. The following are some examples of unacceptable academic practices that will be viewed as policy violations. It is unacceptable to submit the work of another person as your own. If you quote, summarize, paraphrase, or use the ideas of another, you must accurately attribute that information. If you do not acknowledge the source, you are plagiarizing. Academic dishonesty also includes unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting the same assignment for multiple classes without instructor permission; taking an examination for another person and many other situations. If you are unsure whether you are plagiarizing or how to cite a source please ask an instructor or staff member for help prior to turning in the assignment. In this course, the first offense of plagiarism and/or cheating will result in a score of zero on the assignment, quiz or test and reporting of the incident to college administration. Further plagiarism and/or cheating may result in immediate failure of the course and additional consequences determined by college administration. If you have cheated in other ITC courses that will count as your first offense. In other words, if you have cheated in ITC courses before cheating in this course may result in immediately failing the course and additional consequences determined by college administration. All instances of cheating will be reported to the college administration. In addition, plagiarism and cheating are covered by the Student Code of Conduct. Please see the Catalog or IHCC website for details. Students must initiate requests for withdrawal from a course by filing the appropriate form with Enrollment Services. Students who stop attending classes without completing the withdrawal process may receive a grade of “F,” and are responsible for all tuition/fees associated with the course registration. The last day to withdraw from your course will be the date on which 80% of the course has elapsed. The last day to withdraw for each course can be viewed in E-Services by searching for the course at the following link: https://webproc.mnscu.edu/registration/search/basic.html?campusid=157. Click on the course title to view additional details about the course, including last day to withdraw. There are limits as to the latest date you can withdraw from the course and still receive a refund as well as the last date to withdraw from the course at all. Please see the Add, Drop and Withdraw page on the IHCC website: https://inverhills.edu/Registration/AddDropWithdraw.aspx Recognizing the value and efficiency of communication between faculty/staff and students through electronic mail Inver Hills Community College has designated e-mail as an official mode of communication. At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. Therefore, students are asked to regularly check and utilize the email address they have registered with the college. If your email address has changed it is your responsibility to make sure the college has an up-to date email address where you can be contacted. You should check your email on a regular basis as course changes and communications may be sent by email. A student may elect to take a course on a pass/fail (P/F) grading basis by contacting the instructor within the first 5 business days of the semester, or within 1 business day of the start date for a course beginning after the first week of the semester. If the instructor approves, they will submit approval to the Enrollment Center. Not all courses are approved for students to elect the P/F grading method and there may be limits to the total number of classes which can be taken pass/fail in your degree or certificate program. Contact your instructor for details about what level of achievement in the course will be required to receive a pass in the course. Inver Hills values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to fostering mutual respect and full participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning environment that is equitable, inclusive and welcoming. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to your inclusion or learning, please notify me. The Office of Accessibility Resources (OAR) provides reasonable accommodations and assistive technologies for students who encounter barriers in the learning environment. Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. If you have already registered with OAR and have your Letter of Accommodation, please meet with me early in the course to discuss, plan, and implement your accommodations in the course. For additional information, please contact OAR located within the Learning Center (L207), 651-450-3884, accessibilityresources@inverhills.edu or https://www.inverhills.edu/LearningSupport/AccessibilityResources/index.aspx In accordance with federal and state laws, Inver Hills Community College is committed to a policy of free expression and respect for the diversity of beliefs, including religious observances, among our academic community. It is the policy of the college to provide reasonable accommodations for students when religious beliefs and/or observances conflict with classroom activities or course requirements. It is the responsibility of students to notify instructors of the need for accommodation at the beginning of the course or as soon as a situation arises. If a mutually agreed accommodation is not made, a student may initiate a complaint. The procedure for filing a complaint is described in the Catalog and on the Inver Hills website. The complaint must be filed within 15 days of a denied accommodation request. The instructor reserves the right to modify and adjust this syllabus as needed during the course of this class. The most up to date version will always be available on the course website or from the instructor.

You will be responsible for completing required readings in the textbook or online, watching tutorial videos, listening to recorded podcasts, completing labs in the IHCC virtual lab environment, participating in online discussions, and completing online exams. Grades will be determined by performance on unit multiple-choice tests, lab exercises, participation, a skills exam, and a final exam. A description of assignments and directions for assignments are available from the course website. It is expected that assignments will be completed and turned in on time and as specified. Failure to turn in one or more assignments without approval from the instructor may result in an additional lack of participation penalty of up to 20% of your course grade depending on the type of the assignment. If assignments are turned in late 10% will be deducted for each day or partial day the assignment is late. If you are turning in an assignment late you must contact the instructor for information before the due date. Failure to do so may result in additional penalties. The grading of late assignments is given a lower priority and may take longer so students are encouraged to plan ahead and turn in assignments on time. Penalty-free deadline extensions will not be given without written documentation from a licensed medical practitioner or other extenuating circumstances at the discretion of the instructor. Letter Grade Percentage Range Description A 100%-90% achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements B 89%-80% achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet course requirements C 79%-70% achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect D 69%-65% achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully the course requirements F 64%-0% Represents failure and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) N Represents no credit and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I) I Represents incomplete and is assigned at the discretion of the instructor when, due to extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student is prevented from completing the work of the course on time. Requires a written agreement between instructor and student. Students must request an incomplete from the instructor. Grades for this course are calculated based on a weighted points system. Each assignment, quiz or test is assigned to one of the weighted categories below and is graded on a points system. Your percentage is calculated for each category by dividing the points earned in that category by the points available. Finally, your percentage earned in each category is multiplied by the weight of that category and these are added together. The instructor may round up based on student participation and individual improvement. Category Percent of Final Grade Topic Assessments 20% Lab Assignments 30% Written Final Exam 15% Skills Based Final Exam 15% Homework, Activities & Participation 20% Mid-Term grades are not officially distributed but assignment scores are made available in the online grade book as assignments are graded and you may calculate your current course grade at any time using the above instructions and weighting. It is strongly suggested that if you want to know where you stand in the class you re-create your own copy of the gradebook with appropriate weights in a spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets where you can estimate scores you will likely get on future assignments and run other \"what-if\" scenarios. Be aware that the final grade in online gradebooks may be calculated in a way which ignores any assignments you have not turned in. At the end of the semester assignments which have not been turned in will have scores of 0 recorded in the gradebook. If you have missing assignments this may cause your grade to suddenly drop from what was previously shown. It is your responsibility to know what assignments you have not completed, that those will become 0s if not turned in, and how that will affect your grade. === Extra Credit Students should not rely on extra credit to boost their grade and should instead complete each assignment to the best of their ability. However, from time to time extra credit opportunities may arise at which time they will be announced in class, by email and/or through the course website. Extra credit will be added to the Homework, Activities & Participation category. After the first class meeting formal attendance will not be taken; however, students are expected to arrive to class on time and participate in class. Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled. If attendance is a problem participation assignments may be given and included in the course grade. If an illness or emergency results in an absence, students should contact their instructors as soon as possible to determine if missed work can be completed. A student may receive a course grade of FN or NC after two consecutive weeks of unexcused absence at any time during the semester. Class attendance is defined as being physically present in the classroom. Online attendance is defined as having submitted an assignment, taken a quiz, or posted/made a course content-related comment on the discussion/chat board for the course in which the student is registered. You will need daily access to a high-speed internet connection (DSL, cable modem, 4G, fiber, or equivalent) and a modern computer to successfully complete this course. Academic integrity is one of the most important values in higher education. This principle requires that each student’s work represents his or her own personal efforts and that the student acknowledges the intellectual contributions of others. The foundation for this principle is student academic honesty. IHCC students are expected to honor the requirements of the College Academic Integrity Policy. The following are some examples of unacceptable academic practices that will be viewed as policy violations. It is unacceptable to submit the work of another person as your own.

The various sections of the report are clearly identified and all sections of the report were addresses/included in the report. There are a few typos and grammatical mistakes in the report and there is probably a little too much detail included in the \"What we did/What was the purpose\" section of the report. What we did/What was the purpose Today we disassembled and reassembled a desktop computer. After putting on an anti-ESD wrist strap and grounding it, Adam and I started by removing both sides of the case and taking out the mounting screws for the optical drive and HDD. Doing this first, but not intentionally, reminded us to make sure we had a means to keep our tiny screws contained and organized. We then started disconnecting all power cables from the PSU, the serial port, the front panel wires to the motherboard and both SATA cables. (I’m actually glad we didn’t look before blindly disconnecting them, as it only reinforced the need to cross check the diagrams on the inside of the case later on.) With all cables disconnected we could start taking out components. Without any screws keeping them safely stable, the first two taken out were the optical and HDD, then the serial port and the GPU. With all components out the way we could now remove the motherboard. (We waited on its mounting screws so as not to accidentally dislodge the board and damage it earlier on.) After removing the board we could now take out the RAM, take off the CPU fan and remove the CPU from the ZIF, placing them safely on some anti-static plastic. Fully disassembled we were ready for reassembly. Reassembly abridged: RAM, CPU, fan, mobo w/mounting screws, serial, GPU (later discovered to be a pain in the butt when trying to connect front panel audio power), optical drive and HDD w/mounting screws, power connectors, data cables. After reassembly assessment, we failed to properly install the CPU fan and serial cable. Reasons for both included guesswork letting us down. It “seemed” tight enough and it “looked” like it was connected right. Nope. After they were fixed we finished closing it up, connected peripherals and powered it on. All was good except for the power light indicator. This was the only connection in the whole reassembly that seemed to fight logic as the wire label didn’t logically aim away from the board like the rest of the wires. Logic failed us. Or maybe the other way around. After the fix, it was smooth sailing till the end. Both Adam and I have built our own desktops in the past and so had a collective knowledge decent enough to complete the exercise. We did a nice job working through the disassembly and reassembly taking turns nonchalantly disconnecting and reconnecting components all the while having a fun time and getting it done in a timely manner. This lab provided us not just a hands-on reinforcement of the last chapters, but also a means of getting comfortable working with a partner and relying on them. And we had fun doing it. Bonus! Difficulties we faced/how we overcame them Labs are perfect for learning from your failures and doing so promptly without catastrophic consequences. We did make a few mistakes, but luckily they were pretty minimal. We connected a few cables in the wrong direction, and we did not lock the pegs of the CPU fan into place during installation. The two cables that we connected incorrectly were the case power light cable, and the serial cable. In both of these cases there was a visual cue on the cable that allowed us to correctly orient them when we went back to fix it Had we slowed down during the lab, we probably would have made fewer mistakes. We could have checked and rechecked ourselves and made it perfect, but instead, we not only eventually made it perfect, but learned how to commit to a deadline, accept and rectify our failures and move on as a team. Which not only can happen, but will happen and knowing how to do this effectively is paramount in all professions. That of course doesn’t mean that we won’t intend on it being perfect. How we tested our lab During the lab we tested our PC a few times using just a monitor. We performed our first test at the very beginning, right after we got our computer. Before we even started the disassembly, we wanted to test the status of the computer before we made any changes. This was mostly to avoid confusing any previous issues with problems that may be caused by us during the disassembly/assembly process. Fortunately the PC worked as expected when we turned it on, and we were able to start disassembling it. The second Time we tested our PC was toward the end of the lab, after the reassembly. We wanted to check that we correctly replaced all of the components and cables, and that nothing was damaged during reassembly. Simply speaking, we wanted to make sure that everything worked again. After turning on the computer, we were happy to see that it booted and displayed something on the monitor. During this test, we neglected to check the case lights on the front, but we were later told that we had connected the case wires to the motherboard incorrectly. Our third test was a duplicate of the second one. Finally it resulted in a successful boot, something on the monitor, and functional case lights. What we learned As mentioned before, we have both built computers outside of class, so we were pretty confident going into the lab. Despite our previous knowledge, there were a few things that we were unsure about. Anywhere we were unsure we made a mistake, but the mistakes provided the most opportunity for learning. When we installed the CPU fan, we pushed the pegs down without locking them into place. During the lab we had a small discussion about which direction the arrow was supposed to point. Because we were both unsure, we ended up installing the fan incorrectly. From our mistake we learned that the fan pegs are unlocked when the arrows are pointing inward. We also connected a couple of cables in the wrong orientation. The cables were not keyed, which contributed to our confusion, but it prevented us from breaking things. Both of the cables that we connected incorrectly have visual cues that indicate their direction. On the small 2-pin case wires the white wire connects to the negative pin, and on the serial wire, the red line indicates the side with the firs pin. Because we connected the wires incorrectly, we were able to reinforce the visual cues by fixing our mistake.

Once this was done, I recorded my VM’s IP address so I could check my ability to connect with it remotely with VPN + SSH and with FileZilla. Difficulties I Faced/How I Overcame Them My difficulties were many and varied. While the VPN software install was easy, my password was incorrect, preventing me from connecting with the ITC server. Eventually my password was reset and I was able to connect. Next was the vSphere web client. While I was a little worried that the directions in Step 8.3 asked me to do something I could not do (grayed-out \"Browse\" button), I kept going, figuring since the file name looked right, everything would be ok. Unfortunately the network autoconfig step failed, which prevented further steps. Eventually I got stuck with the \"install sudo\" step since I had no network connection. I came in on Friday morning and asked Tom to let me into B-109 so I could work on this some more. He suggested that I simply start over the install, so we went into BIOS, switch the boot order to CD first, and proceeded with the re-install. This time there were no problems with the install. When I tried to test the remote connection via SSH, I initially failed because I had powered down the VM. Once it was back up, I still could not get in. However, I was using \"j.gower\" instead of \"jason\" for my user name - d’oh! My final problem was with changing my password on the ITC server. Specifically, Ctrl + Alt + Del did not give me a \"Change password\" option. Eventually I tried Ctrl + Alt + End and I did get the option, so was able to change my password. How I Tested My Lab I tested the VPN software by simply activating the software and entering my credentials (once I had the correct credentials). I got a message saying I was connected, but there was no install yet, so that’s all I could do at that point. Similarly, vSphere accepted my login credentials, so they were correct. The install itself was tested by powering down the VM and powering it back on. Sure enough, my screen showed a login so the install took. Next I checked the sudo install when I attempted to discover the VM’s IP address with ifconfig. I then checked that IP address by using VPN + SSH to make a remote connection from home, which worked. This was further checked by using FileZilla to SFTP in and see what little I have in my home directory. What I Learned I had never really used a VPN before, but no biggie — it’s just an application that I need to have up and running before I can remotely access my VM. I also have never used a VM, but again, no biggie — once we have the install, I’ll SSH in and won’t really notice the difference between being on a VM or just a remote machine. I had used Telnet/SSH many years ago, so nothing new there, either. What I did learn is how easy it is to install Debian, at least in a very basic configuration. I had heard stories in the past that Debian was harder to get into than some of the other distros. Or maybe I’m confusing Debian with Slackware?) In any case, it was so easy, I think I’ll install it on an old laptop and run through the labs on it, just to get additional practice. Finally, I had never worked with FileZilla before. In the past, I would just use a browser and enter in \"sftp://…​\". So I learned how cool FileZilla is — it’s very nice to have the two views, one for my local machine file system and one for the remote machine’s file system. Cool!

After, we set up the different interfaces on the routers and made sure the connections were working as expected. Our next task was configuring OSPF routing on the network, and after a few hiccups in the configuration we were able to continue to configure the PC’s and verify the overall connection of our network using OSPF. Part 2: We added passwords for logging in, the enable class, telnet, and ssh in this section, as well as configuring the SSH server on the routers. Then we preceded to encrypt all of the passwords being used so they were no longer a security risk in a real setting, as well as add a MOTD warning banner. After we made sure SSH was working, we experimented with using SCP and configuring the server for it on a router so that the configuration file of Router 1 could be saved to flash memory and copied over to Router 3. Part 3: The next section had us making many administrative roles in the routers, varying from the main admin to an assistant admin, and even a technician. We then altered all of the roles with custom rule sets on the commands they could operate with and messed around in all of them to see the limited set up. Part 4: This section had us secure different boot files so they could not be viewed from within the router unless a user had privileges to make them no longer secure. Followed by configuring SNMP Security on the network. This included setting up a standard access list to add the SNMP view to, and then make a group and user to allow it to be used. The next part of the section was using a router as a synchronized clock for the network using NTP on our network. The last part of the section was configuring Syslog on the router and installing a Syslog Server and enabling it. Part 5: We then configured a key chain on the three routers using the SHA256 encryption. Then we applied the OSPF key-chain to all of the interfaces that called for it, and again verified it was all working. Part 6: This last section was fairly straight forward and we used AutoSexure Cisco feature to secure the router with only a few prompts for us the fill in. The interesting part of the section was comparing the configuration it came up with the one pulled off R1 by R3 using SCP. Issues We Faced/How We Overcame Them While cabling our lab we ran into a few issues, our PCs were plugged into the wrong switch ports which resulted in not being able to ping our default gateways. This turned out to be an easy fix, however we had to do a fair amount of troubleshooting to figure out the issue. Obviously within the OSI model, we should have defaulted to looking at our physical hardware as a starting point for troubleshooting this issue. After fixing that issue, we had a difficult time getting OSPF configured on router 3. We did our due diligence and double checked our static routes, however we still couldn’t so a show ip ospf neighbor. What we ended up realizing, after a little assistance from Ben, was that OSPF was configured with the same routes on all three routers. After modifying our configs, we had OSPF up and running, and were able to ping each other’s PCs. The last major roadblock we encountered was after enabling OSPF authentication using SHA256. After inputting the show ip ospf neighbor command we still weren’t getting our routes to show up so we turned our attention to R2. After digging through the output of a sh run on R2 we determined that we never set up OSPF authentication on R2. After plugging in our authentication key commands we saw confirmation messages on both R1 and R3. How We Tested Our Lab Part 1: To test OSPF we used show ip ospf neighbor to view from each router what they could see as their neighbors. We looked for the addresses of the other networks we knew should be able to be seen and were able to troubleshoot the configuration until each router’s return of the command was what we wanted. Show ip route was also used to verify the connections made by the routers. And the final bit of testing was making sure R1 could ping R3, and PC-A could ping PC-C. Part 2: To test the minimum password we made sure one with less characters returned an error message. After making all the passwords and encrypting them, we used show run to go back and view them and make sure they appeared encrypted in the configuration file. Then to make sure the passwords were working as intended we logged out of the routers and then logged back in making sure the passwords were applied correctly, and we did the same thing for the SSH and telnet connections. Making sure the passwords we included were functioning as intended and encrypted. We also tested our password fail retry policy and attempts made to make sure it was also function. Testing the SCP server was done by completing the task of pulling the R1 configuration file from it to R3, and when that was done and we verified the file was good to go we knew that section was done. Part 3: To test the administrative roles we created, after making each one we entered into the view using parser view X and made sure the password assigned to was working correctly, and that it could not preform any of the commands that were not alotted to it. To do this we tested commands that shouldn’t work and they did not. And we made sure commands that were able to work did. Part 4: To verify the image and configuration files were secured, we made sure they did not appear in the flash read out after being secured. And that they were again visible after being unsecured. To test the SNMP security, we used show snmp group to view the configurations we made and to verify they looked as they should. And the show snmp user command to make sure the user was configured correctly as well. To make sure the NTP and clock was working we used the show clock to verify the times between all the routers were done correctly. The debug ntp all command to make sure the messages between the routers were coming and going. Part 5: After configuring the key-chain and OSPF configuration again, we used show ip ospf neighbor to verify the routers could see the ones neighboring them, as well as show ip route to make sure the routers have all of the connections they should. Part 6: This was tested by just making the new configuration had been implemented correctly by AutoSecure and looked at the differences between it and the one that had been loaded over from R1. What We Learned In this lab we learned a few things about securing our routers. Part 1 and Part 2 were mainly set up for the rest of the lab, and mostly review. In Part 3 we started learning about securing our routers and maintaining control over those accessing the router. We configured multiple different role views that had varying levels of privileges. This is a very important step in maintaining control of the network. Our goal is always to be using the principle of least privilege. There is no reason that a level 1 network technician should be messing with routing protocols, but it might be beneficial for them to view them. This is a very good way to make sure these privileges are separate. In Part 4 we learned about Cisco IOS Resilience which is a good way of making sure our routers are behaving properly using monitoring tools. Syslog is a great way of creating a timestamped log file to be later referenced. In Part 5 of this lab we learned about securing the control plane. Making sure the way our routers are communicating with each other does not change unless it should be a very important step in security. By setting up OSPF authentication we can prevent unauthorized access to modification of OSPF routes. Part 6 was interesting because on the face of it, required very little interacting from us. We answered a few questions and AutoSecure was able to provide us with a secure configuration for the router. While it’s important to make sure you know what kind of security and commands are applied to your router, AutoSecure seems like an equally beneficial way to go.

The purpose of the first lab was to configure a switched network with redundant links so that we could examine the process of determining a root bridge and see how STP selects ports based on cost or priority. The objective of the second lab configure a switched network to examine convergence in a PVST+ network versus Rapid PVST+ with PortFast and BPDU Guard. For both labs, we followed the instructions as outlined. Problems & Solutions We only had 1 problem while working through these 2 labs. We didn’t check that all of the switches had been reloaded properly. We incorrectly made the assumption that if the first was clear, then the rest would be, too. This became a problem when we checked the VLANs we’d created and noticed there were a few there that we had not created. Since we’d already configured quite a bit, we decided to use the no vlan command to remove the unwanted VLANs from the database so we didn’t have to delete vlan.dat and reload the switch. Once we had all the VLANs matching on the three switches, we were able to verify connectivity. How We Tested the Lab As usual, we tested the labs by making sure our output matched what was expected according to the lab instructions. For the first lab, we tested connectivity of switches after initial configuration and setup by using the ping command. After configuring STP, we used the show spanning-tree command to determine the root bridge, as well as the bridge priority and port roles on each switch. We used the same command to view STP changes after we changed the port cost on the blocked port, as well as when we viewed changes based on port priority. In the second lab, we didn’t verify anything until after configuring VLANs. We used the show vlan brief command to check that we’d configured the correct VLANs ad assigned the required ports. (This is where we noticed that one of the switches had not been properly reloaded by the last user.) We checked trunk interfaces by using the show interfaces trunk command. We also verified all the other configuration settings we made by using the show running-config command. Then we tested connectivity of our configuration with a ping from PC-A to PC-B. We used the debug spanning-tree events to watch the process of convergence happening after we shutdown a port. (We used no debug spanning-tree events to turn it off.) We used the same commands to view convergence with PVST+ and Rapid PVST+ configurations. All of our tests with both labs were successful. What We Learned In the first lab, we learned there are several numbers that can affect the election of the root bridge in STP. First, the switches look to the priority number (or combination of priority number and vlan id). If the priority is equal, then the switches will use the lowest MAC address. In order to determine port roles, switches look at the port cost for each port involved. Because defaults might lead to sub-optimal network switching, both the priority and port cost can be configured by an administrator. Finally, if port cost and bridge IDs are equal, port roles are determined by the port number, with the lowest port number taking priority. In the second lab, we learned about PVST+ and Rapid PVST+. The default setting for spanning-tree mode on Cisco switches is PVST+. We learned how to configure a primary and secondary root bridge using the spanning-tree vlan root primary and spanning-tree vlan root secondary commands. While using a debug command to watch network convergence, we learned that Rapid PVST+ converges noticeably quicker that PVST+. Using PortFast helps with faster convergence, because it allows configured ports to go directly into forwarding mode, rather than cycling through all the steps to get there. Additionally, BPDU Guard helps protect a port by shutting it down if it receives a BPDU packet (which is not the expectation on a port where it is enabled), allowing time for an administrator to check and see if some topology change happened which would require re-configuration of the port. Overall, we learned there are several configuration factors that can be set to influence traffic patterns on a network.

If labs in this class are done in groups you should turn in a single lab report for each lab completed. If labs are individual you will need to turn in your own lab report which is unique to you. Lab reports should be typed and should include the following information: Lab group members (only names on the report for a lab will receive credit for it, also do not list someone who did not actually work on the lab that is cheating) Course and section number Lab number and title A detailed description of what you did for the lab in your own words A detailed description of any problems or difficulties you encountered with the lab as well as how you solved them A description of how you tested your lab and what the results were A description of what new material or skills you learned in this lab See detailed information about some of these sections below. Please be as detailed as possible. Remember, points will be awarded based on the information on this report. The less information included the fewer opportunities for the instructor to award points. Lab reports serve multiple purposes including getting you to think critically about what you’ve just done (metacognition) as well as to provide evidence that you were able to successfully complete the lab. Showing that you are thinking critically about the lab is a good way to score highly on lab reports. If there is evidence that you did not actually complete the lab yourself you may receive a zero on the lab report even if the submitted report is well written. Instead of asking you to complete questions found in lab books you will create a narrative report on the lab in much the same format you might do in a science or other lab-based course. The advantages of this format is that you will do better quality lab work, get a better understanding of the lab concepts, and have an opportunity to practice valuable technical writing soft-skills. We have developed a lab report format which focuses on four key areas for reflection. These areas are: a description of what you did, what difficulties you had and how you overcame those difficulties, a description of how you tested the lab and a look back on what you learned from the lab. Significant thought was given to selecting these as the key areas for the reports and below are some thoughts about the what the intended purpose and outcome of each area is. The purpose of this section is to engage you in a metacognitive exercise thinking about what they did in this particular lab. Particularly in the case of highly prescriptive, step-oriented, labs students often will go through them following the directions but have no idea at the end about what they just did at a broader level and why it is an important thing to learn. In this section we’re looking for a description of the lab in your own words. At a higher level of evaluation we’re looking for evidence that you are aware of how this lab fits into the content of the course as a whole and into the IT field. In the grading of lab reports we often give less emphasis to this area as it’s intended more to force you to think about what they have done. We want you to think about that but we already know what you did, or at least what you were supposed to do so it’s less important from a grading perspective. The purpose of this section is to assist us in determining what the “hard parts” of the lab were for you and to confirm that you were able to work through them or that you need additional reinforcement on these concepts. An added benefit here is that you need to think though what your troubleshooting process was and ideally what additional efficiencies might be gained or what worked well in that process. This is a critical area from a grading perspective. We can gain significant insight into how the lab worked out for you and what the learning process was for you by reading this section. Particularly in labs which are less step-by-step in nature you may often think “are we done with this lab?”. This section requires students think about what it means to have been successful in completing the lab. Just as in the workplace students need to know when they can move on to another project or if there is more to do. We want to get you used to checking to make sure things are working as they expect after doing any system configuration or making a change as well as look to see that you did successfully complete the lab activity. In a similar way to the first section we want to force you to go though the process of thinking about testing the lab but it’s not critical from a grading perspective so we generally weight this section somewhat less than the others. You should be extremely thorough in this section. Every new concept or command that is introduced in the lab should be thoroughly tested and the testing documented in the report. Many times the lab instructions themselves do '''not''' thoroughly test the technologies used in the lab. Part of doing the lab is to come up with a testing plan ''yourself'' and to document and carry out that testing. It is absolutely unacceptable to simply say that testing of the lab was done by following the instructions. This does not show you know anything about what is supposed to work at all. This is a high value section of the lab report. Fundamentally the purpose of labs is to teach you new skills and to have you practice those skills. This section forces you to think about what you got, or should have gotten, out of doing the lab exercise. Sometimes you may have a difficult time understanding why we do lab exercises and you don’t immediately see the value in doing them. Here the goal is to have you try and come up with a narrative about what new things you learned or what was reinforced by the exercise, which is of course the purpose of having you do it. Hopefully we can see evidence that it was a worthwhile activity for you and that you truly did engage in the learning process. Undoubtedly this is the most critical section for grading purposes. Just as you want to know that they accomplished something worthwhile we are fundamentally interested in knowing that you had a positive learning outcome as well. Below are some example lab reports posted by students. These are certainly not perfect lab reports but are meant to give you a starting point about what a lab report might look like. You should look at many of these, not just ones for your class, so that you have a good idea of what sort of thing is expected in your reports.

This page explains how the site works and how to make updates to the site. The site is comprised of static pages hosted on GitHub pages which are generated programmatically from AsciiDoc files using the Antora site generator. The complete source code for the site can be found in the itc-docs GitHub repository. A GitHub workflow exists which automatically runs the Antora site generator and then deploys the site to GitHub pages each time a push to any YYYY.MM branch is made. The code for this workflow is also in the same repository. If you do not have commit access to the itc-docs repository you will need to fork the repository on GitHub, download a copy, edit the files, upload to your forked repository, and then submit a pull request. It is strongly suggested that you setup the same Antora build workflow on your forked repository or run Antora locally to build and test your edits before submitting the pull request. If you do have commit access to the itc-docs repository you can update your local copy, make changes, commit, and push to GitHub as you would with any normal source repository. Update your local branch git pull Commit changes to all modified files with an short explanation of the changes git add -A git commit -m \"a short explanation of what has been changed\" Upload changes to the remote repository (assuming you have commit permission there) git push Antora is setup to automatically build multiple versions of the site based on the branches in Git that are identified by a branch name like YYYY.MM. The idea is that a new branch will be created from the main branch at the beginning of each semester in the YYYY.MM format. This branch will be used for changes made during that semester. At the end of the semester the changes will be merged back into the main branch. That way the final version of the site each semester will continue to be available as the latest commit of each branch. The YYYY.MM format was chosen as they will sort correctly to find the latest branch. For example at the beginning of Fall 2022 a branch 2022.08 will be created and at the beginning of Spring 2023 a branch 2023.01 will be created. Create a branch at the beginning of the semester and switch to that branch git pull git checkout -b \"YYYY.MM\" Upload changes to the new branch the first time by specifying it git push --set-upstream origin YYYY.MM At the end of the semester merge changes back into the main branch and upload it git checkout main git merge YYYY.MM git push As mentioned, the site uses AsciiDoc as the format for individual pages. The documentation for AsciiDoc is the first place to start if you want to know how to format something on a page. Because the site itself is built using the Antora program their documentation explains the heirarchy of directories and files, as well as some quirks to the AsciiDoc format specific to Antora. The easiest way is to click the \"Edit this Page\" link in the upper right corner of any page. This will take you to an edit screen showing the page source and location. However, unless you have commit access to the repository you will need to fork the repository and submit a pull request as described above in order to make a change on the live site. Antora organizes things into \"components\" which are parents to \"modules\". Each module can hold a number of pages, snippets (called partials), examples, images, and attachments. The idea is that the different components can be pulled from different Git repositories at build time and so can have different owners/permissions. Things can be linked or included between components and modules as needed. For this site the major sections of the site, including a separate section for each faculty member that wants one (so they can be pulled from individual repositories), are their oen components. Most components are only using a \"root\" module at this time as there are a relatively limited number of pages in most components. The notable exception to this is that faculty components are likely to be divided into a module for each course so that various course pages, lab activities, images, attachments, etc. can be held together. The design and layout of the site is controlled by the UI bundle which is part of the Antora playbook. A JavaScript based search capability has been added to the site using the Lunr module for Antora. This is included in the build process through the build workflow and enabled in the playbook.
