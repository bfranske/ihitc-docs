Inver Hills Community College will grant credit equivalencies to many Information Technology & Careers (ITC, CS) courses based on certification exam results indicating a passing score which meet the following criteria:
. Exam is administered by Pearson VUE, Thomson/Prometric, Certiport or a future authorized industry certification testing company. Certification results are confirmed directly from certifying agent (e.g., Cisco, Microsoft, CompTIA) through mail, secure website or other means initiated by the certifying agent. The student is responsible for making arrangements to provide this documentation.
. The certification exam is based on outcomes and objectives that correspond substantially to the content being taught in current courses. In cases where the current course content is based on technology that is substantially different from the certification exam taken by the student, credit will not be granted. Students my retake exams to qualify for credit equivalency.
. In the case of certifications with expiration dates the certification is not expired. In the case of individual exams or certifications without expiration dates the exam taken is the most current version.

Due to constantly evolving industry certifications specific exams are no longer listed in the course catalog with course equivalencies. A faculty member from the ITC department will review all credit equivalencies for ITC courses and determine whether the exam taken or certification obtained substantially corresponds to the course. A general guideline of common course equivalencies can be found on the ITC department website or by contacting one of the ITC instructors. Examples of certifications commonly accepted for course credit include the CompTIA A+, Cisco CCNA, CCNA Specializations, CCNP, Microsoft MCITP and Microsoft Office Specialist tracks.

*The table below is a general guideline of common course equivalencies and does not assure the academic credit will be granted for specific exams.*  Exams vary in content and structure over time and may not measure the current outcomes and objectives of a course; in such cases, credit cannot be given for current courses. A faculty member from the ITC department will review all credit equivalencies for ITC courses and determine whether the exam taken or certification obtained substantially corresponds to the course.
