= Degrees and Certificates

Like most IT departments Inver Hills Community College divides offerings related to computers into two broad areas (though there is some crossover), information technology infrastructure and programming. There are two degrees and six certificates in the information technology infrastructure area and two degrees in the programming area. Networking, Internet access, server administration, hardware, operating systems, and PCs tend to fall in the information technology infrastructure area. Writing software, apps, sofware design, and algorithms tend to fall into the computer science/programming area.

== Information Technology Infrastructure

IT infrastructure personnel are responsible for installing, configuring, operating, and maintaining PCs, servers, network devices, network links, and cybersecurity devices and software required for businesses to operate.

Many of the classes in our degrees and certificates are aligned with professional industry certifications. If you already have one or more of these certifications you may be able to receive credit for courses. Review the xref:certification-credit.adoc[ITC Course Credit Equivalency for IT Exams] chart and then contact a faculty member for more information.

====
Many of the courses in ITC degree programs have prerequisites which effectively limit the number of technical courses which can be take in any one semester. In order to ensure timely graduation, appropriate course loads, and the correct mix of technical and liberal arts courses students are strongly encouraged to meet with an academic advisor, counselor, and having that plan reviewed by a faculty member from the ITC department before registering for classes to determine a degree plan.
