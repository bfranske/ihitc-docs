= ITC-2000 Assignment Details and Directions

== Labs
For each topic listed below having lab activities you will need to submit one xref:lab-reports:index.adoc[lab report] which covers all of the lab activities listed below the topic. Submissions are made through the NetAcad site. You do not need to submit answers to the questions in the activities, those are for your own learning use only. Lab activities may include remote equipment access or campus equipment. *Good lab reports in this class are typically 400-700 words long.* Each lab report is worth up to 20 points.

TIP: If you have not done lab reports in one of Dr. Franske's classes before, or you want to try and score better on lab reports, be sure to check out the xref:lab-reports:index.adoc[instructions for writing lab reports page and example reports]!

=== PC Disassembly/Reassembly Labs
In this lab activity you will completely disassmble and then re-assemble a small form factor computer. If time allows you may also assemble a computer from parts. 

You should primarily refer to the demonstration disassembly and re-assembly that was done in class but if you need additional reminders of the steps you may refer to the following lab activites in the Cisco Networking Academy curriculum:

* 1.3.2.3 Lab - Disassemble a Computer
* 2.1.2.5 Lab - Install the Power Supply
* 2.1.3.10 Lab - Install the Motherboard in a Computer
* 2.1.4.7 Lab - Install the Drives
* 2.1.5.6 Lab - Install Adapter Cards
* 2.1.7.4 Lab - Install Internal Cables
* 2.1.7.8 Lab - Install the Front Panel Cables
* 2.1.7.11 Lab - Complete the Computer Assembly

=== Boot/BIOS Labs
* 3.1.1.6 Lab - Investigate BIOS or UEFI Settings
+
--
NOTE: Before beginning this lab activity you will need to find the key to tap while the computer is powering on which gives access to the BIOS or UEFI. You will need to look this up on Google for the particular model of computer or motherboard you are working with as different manufacturers use different keys.
--
* 3.1.2.5 Lab - Search for BIOS or UEFI Firmware Updates
+
--
NOTE: Most modern BIOS or UEFI systems do not display POST messages like those shown in the lab anymore unless you specifically are able to disable the _splash screen_ in the BIOS or UEFI settings. Even in that case the POST sometimews goes by too quickly to see any results on the screen.

NOTE: Because you will need to search the Internet for the most recent BIOS version by your motherboard or system manufacturer you will need a working Internet connection to your computer. You will need to complete the next two labs and get Windows installed before you're able to finish that part of this lab activity.
--
* 3.1.2.6 Lab - Install Windows
+
--
NOTE: You may need to go into the BIOS/UEFI settings of your system and eithe change the boot order of the system or make sure the system is set to UEFI boot mode instead of legacy boot mode in order to start the Windows installer from the USB drive.

NOTE: Make sure your computer is *NOT* connected to the Internet while Windows is being installed on it so that you can create a local account instead of being forced to use a Microsoft account! You will need to confirm during the setup process that you have no Internet connection and that you want to continue with "Limited Setup" because Microsoft really wants to force you to use a Microsoft Account to sign in.

NOTE: Be sure to choose a new installation, not to repair an existing one. If prompted choose to install "Windows 10 Education" or "Windows 10 Enterprise". Also, choose to do a "Custom" installation, not an upgrade, and delete any/all existing partitions on the drive (note that this will erase all data on the computer).

NOTE: If you are prompted for a license or activation key choose that you do not have one or to skip the step.

NOTE: During the account creation process use the name "ITC Admin" and the password "Password123!" be sure to write them down and have your partner write them down as well because you will need them again later in the course.
--
* 3.1.2.7 Lab - Install Third-Party Software in Windows 
+
--
NOTE: You will need to connect your computer to the Internet in order to complete this part of the lab activity. Get a network cable from your instructor and attach to one of the network jacks at your table, let your instructor know what the jack number is you are plugged into and they will verify that Internet access has been activated on that jack.

NOTE: You will need to download the Packet Tracer software from the Cisco Networking Academy site and copy it to your computer to install it. Find the link to download Packet Tracer under the _Resources_ menu at the top of the Legacy NetAcad website. You will want the latest 64-bit Windows version.

NOTE: You may also want to download and install a better web browser for your system such as Chrome or Firefox instead of using Microsoft Edge.

=== Hardware Troubleshooting Labs
* 4.2.3.6 Lab â€“ Troubleshoot Hardware Problems 
+
--
NOTE:  In this lab you are asked to troubleshoot any problems with your hardware. After making sure your system is working properly obtain sheets from the instructor with a series of problems to create for your partner. Be sure to have your partner leave the room while you are creating each problem (one problem at a time!).
--

=== Networking Labs
IMPORTANT: For the lab activities in this section you will need two computers with wired network connections. Use your desktop PC as one computer and an ITC department laptop for the second computer. The password for the ITC department laptops is _pass@word1_

IMPORTANT: Make sure your systems do not have an Internet connection unless the lab specifically states to connect to the Internet. On the laptops this will mean you may need to disable the wireless network interface or disconnect from the wireless network.

TIP: It is strongly suggested that before you start your lab today you do a factory reset on your routers to clear any old settings. On the TP-Link Archer AC1200 routers the manual states to press and hold the "Reset" button on the back of the router with a pen or paperclip until the Power LED binks (at least 5 seconds) and then wait for the router to reboot to reset it.

* 6.1.2.7 Lab - Configure a NIC to Use DHCP in Windows
+
--
NOTE: Do *NOT* connect your router or computer to an Internet connection, it's not required for this lab.

NOTE: In this lab you are asked to open a command prompt window. In older versions of Windows the command prompt was an option in the start menu, but it was removed from there starting in Windows 10. To launch a command prompt in WIndows 10 or 11 just click on the start menu and start typing "cmd" or "Command Prompt" and you will find it.

* 6.1.3.10 Lab - Configure a Wireless Network
+

NOTE: Do *NOT* connect your router or computer to an Internet connection, it's not required for this lab.

NOTE: In Part 2, Step 1 you should add the MAC addresses of both your computers to the allowed list of MACs on the router.

NOTE: In Part 2, Step 2 you should add the IP address of ONE of your computers to the DMZ on the router.

NOTE: In Part 2, Step 3 you should add a port forwarding rule to forward port 80 to the IP address of the OTHER one of your computers. Also note that different manufacturers call "port forwarding" different things. For example TP-Link calls it "virtual servers" instead in some models of routers.
--
* 6.2.2.5 Lab - Troubleshoot Network Problems
+
--
NOTE: In this lab you will connect your router to an Internet connection. Connect the WAN/Internet port on the router to the wired network jack in the room.

NOTE: Obtain sheets with two lists of problems to create from the instructor. Create these problems for your partner one at a time while they are out of the room and ask them to fix your network. If you are unsure of how to create the issue ask your instructor for help.

NOTE: *Before you leave today please reset your router to the factory default settings.*
