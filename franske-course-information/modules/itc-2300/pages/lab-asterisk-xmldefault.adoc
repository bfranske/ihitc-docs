= ITC-2300 VoIP Labs XMLDefault Configuration for Cisco Phones

== Notes

This file is requested by Cisco IP phones from the TFTP server which is set in option 150 of the DHCP settings. In our case we have setup option 150 to point to our Debian server which is also running a TFTP server. Once the phones download this file from the TFTP server they read it and attempt to register with the VoIP server IP address specfied inside. In our case that IP is the same as the TFTP server because Asterisk is running on the same server.
