<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assignments in this course will consist of a goals and expectations paper, an engineering journal/work reflection log, two faculty supervisor meetings, an end of internship performance review by your employer, and an end of internship paper. A detailed description of these assignments and their requirements can be found in the ITC Internship Student Handbook <a href="guidelines-policies" class="xref page">Guidelines and Policies section</a>. Failure to turn in one or more of these assignments without approval from your instructor may result in an additional lack of participation penalty of up to 20% of your final course grade depending on the type of assignment not completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These assignments will also be used to verify that your internship meets the specific guidelines and requirements for internships in the ITC program as outlined in the ITC Internship Handbook. If your internship fails to meet one or more of the specific guidelines or requirements you should expect a substantially reduced grade on one or more of the assignments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Grades for the course will be computed by weighting these assignments as well as a participation grade based on feedback from your employer and observations by your instructor:</p>

<p>In the event of any substantial changes to your internship situation (before all requirements are met and assignments are turned in) you must contact your instructor as soon as possible and inform them of the change to work out how this may impact your ability to complete the internship course or what steps need to be taken.

<p>You are laid off or terminated during the course of your internship.</p>

Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled. If attendance is a problem participation assignments may be given and included in the course grade. If an illness or emergency results in an absence, students should contact their instructors as soon as possible to determine if missed work can be completed. A student may receive a course grade of FN or NC after two consecutive weeks of unexcused absence at any time during the semester. Class attendance is defined as being physically present in the classroom. Online attendance is defined as having submitted an assignment, taken a quiz, or posted/made a course content-related comment on the discussion/chat board for the course in which the student is registered.</p>

<h3 id="_academic_integrity_plagiarism_and_cheating"><a class="anchor" href="#_academic_integrity_plagiarism_and_cheating"></a>Academic Integrity (Plagiarism and Cheating)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Academic integrity is one of the most important values in higher education. This principle requires that each student&#8217;s work represents his or her own personal efforts and that the student acknowledges the intellectual contributions of others. The foundation for this principle is student academic honesty. IHCC students are expected to honor the requirements of the College Academic Integrity Policy. The following are some examples of unacceptable academic practices that will be viewed as policy violations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the purposes of this policy artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT or automatic summarization systems are "another person". As such they are prohibted unless authorized in advance by your instructor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is unacceptable to submit the work of another person as your own. If you quote, summarize, paraphrase, or use the ideas of another, you must accurately attribute that information. If you do not acknowledge the source, you are plagiarizing. Academic dishonesty also includes unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting the same assignment for multiple classes without instructor permission; taking an examination for another person and many other situations. If you are unsure whether you are plagiarizing or how to cite a source please ask an instructor or staff member for help prior to turning in the assignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this course, the first offense of plagiarism and/or cheating will result in a score of zero on the assignment, quiz or test and reporting of the incident to college administration. Further plagiarism and/or cheating may result in immediate failure of the course and additional consequences determined by college administration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have cheated in other ITC courses that will count as your first offense. In other words, if you have cheated in ITC courses before cheating in this course may result in immediately failing the course and additional consequences determined by college administration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All instances of cheating will be reported to the college administration. In addition, plagiarism and cheating are covered by the Student Code of Conduct. Please see the Catalog or IHCC website for details.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recognizing the value and efficiency of communication between faculty/staff and students through electronic mail Inver Hills Community College has designated e-mail as an official mode of communication. At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. Therefore, students are asked to regularly check and utilize the email address they have registered with the college. If your email address has changed it is your responsibility to make sure the college has an up-to date email address where you can be contacted. You should check your email on a regular basis as course changes and communications may be sent by email.</p>

<h3 id="_passfail_grade_option"><a class="anchor" href="#_passfail_grade_option"></a>Pass/Fail Grade Option</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A student may elect to take a course on a pass/fail (P/F) grading basis by contacting the instructor within the first 5 business days of the semester, or within 1 business day of the start date for a course beginning after the first week of the semester. If the instructor approves, they will submit approval to the Enrollment Center. Not all courses are approved for students to elect the P/F grading method and there may be limits to the total number of classes which can be taken pass/fail in your degree or certificate program.
