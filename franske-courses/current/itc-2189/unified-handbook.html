<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, you need to find an IT position you can use for internship credit. See FAQ #3 below and step 1 of the "ITC Internship Course Enrollment Steps" for more on that. Once you have a position see the section “ITC Internship Course Enrollment Steps” in the <a href="guidelines-policies" class="xref page">guidelines and policies</a> section for detailed steps to get registered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ITC Internship course is not a course where you register and then you find or are placed at an internship. Instead, you take this course to receive credit for internship work experience so you need to have an internship position accepted before you register, this is why instructor approval is required to register.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ITC Internship course is offered every term and, although it only shows a limited number of seats, the course will not fill up as we will expand the course as needed. You can also register for this course even after a term starts so there is not a rush to register for the course. See FAQ #6 for more details.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_when_am_i_ready_to_take_the_internship_course"><a class="anchor" href="#_when_am_i_ready_to_take_the_internship_course"></a>When am I ready to take the internship course?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We normally recommend that you start looking for internship positions anytime after you have completed the ITC 2000 PC Hardware &amp; Software course. The ITC Internship course is offered every term (including summer) and you can also register for this course even after a term starts so as soon as you are hired for a position and have approval from the ITC internship supervisor you can start.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s easier to get hired if you have previous experience in IT. However, we realize this is not normally the case for students! Especially if you do not have previous experience you will probably find it easier to get hired if you have passed professional certification exams so that people know you have some knowledge, skills, and abilities in the IT area. The CompTIA A+ professional certification is a good place to start. If you&#8217;ve taken the ITC PC Hardware &amp; Software course you should be well on your way to passing that certification. It&#8217;s suggested you contact your PC Hardware &amp; Software instructor for advice on passing the certification and take some practice exams to help prepare you. If you already have the CompTIA A+ and have also completed all our CCNA courses passing the CCNA certification is another great way to show you know your way around even more complex IT systems.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_do_i_find_an_internship_position"><a class="anchor" href="#_how_do_i_find_an_internship_position"></a>How do I find an internship position?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will find your internship position the same way you would find any job in the IT field. IHCC does not normally place students at internships, you will seek and find a suitable position yourself. It is strongly suggested you work with the IHCC Career Development office to review your resume, brush up on interview skills, and get tips on job searching <a href="https://www.inverhills.edu/careerdevelopment" class="bare">https://www.inverhills.edu/careerdevelopment</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We realize there are very few positions advertised specifically as internships in the IT field. Most IT jobs can be used for credit in the internship course. See details elsewhere in this handbook for specific requirements for positions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many ITC internship students are just getting into the IT field, in that case it is most likely that you will be looking for and hired into an IT Helpdesk type position. Those can work just fine for your internship as long as the position allow you to do a little bit of project work or job shadowing with other IT positions as well. In particular inside support positions (where you are providing support to other employees) usually have these kinds of opportunities, outside support positions (where you are providing support to customers of the company) usually do not allow for the required opportunities. See detailed position requirements in the Internship Guidelines and step 1 of the “ITC Internship Course Enrollment Steps” both of which are later in this handbook. Ask your IHCC ITC internship supervisor if you have questions about whether a specific job will meet the internship requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When searching for job openings it is useful to know that there are not standardized names for IT positions across companies. Some companies have titles like “Service Desk Analyst I” while others call the same position “IT Support”, “PC Technician”, “Level I Support Analyst”, etc. So, if it at first appears there aren&#8217;t many open jobs try searching with some other terms and also be sure to read through job descriptions, even of jobs that have titles that don&#8217;t sound like what you&#8217;re looking for as they may still work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your first IT position might be a "contract" position with a defined length (such as 6 months) instead of an open-ended job you keep until you leave, are fired, etc. Those contract positions are often easier to get as they typically do not offer benefits and are great options for getting early career experience like with the internship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes positions are advertised through a third party (not the company you will work for) sometimes called a recruiting firm, staffing agency, or headhunting firm. This is especially the case with entry level positions. In fact, you will often see the same position advertised by multiple different recruiting firms with slightly different language. These types positions can also work as internship positions and the recruiting firms can sometimes be of assistance in preparing you for interviews, etc. However, they can also sometimes lead you to apply for jobs which you&#8217;re really not qualified for just so they can get some credit for bringing in people to interview. Be sure you’re not letting them waste too much of your time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best way to find open jobs in IT is to “network”. Ask your friends, family, social media friends, etc. if they know of any open entry level IT positions. It never hurts to make a profile on job networking sites like LinkedIn as well. A good resource for looking for IT jobs is a job search website focused on the tech area. One example of such as site is <a href="https://www.dice.com" class="bare">https://www.dice.com</a> It’s suggested that you upload your resume to these sites and you search the sites for jobs and apply to jobs. As mentioned above there are a lot of different titles for entry level IT jobs so you will probably need to search a lot of terms. Some suggested terms are:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>No problem! We realize there are very few positions advertised specifically as internships in the IT field. Most IT jobs can be used for credit in the internship course. See details elsewhere in this handbook for specific requirements for positions. For advice on looking for a position see the above question.</p>

<h3 id="_what_about_jobs_that_list_a_requirement_for_a_degree_or_experience"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_about_jobs_that_list_a_requirement_for_a_degree_or_experience"></a>What about jobs that list a requirement for a degree or experience?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are encouraged to apply for jobs you think you&#8217;re qualified for even if they list a degree (2 year or 4 year) or experience as a requirement which you don&#8217;t have yet. In many cases these requirements are listed in the hopes they can get someone who has that qualification but that is often times wishful thinking on the part of employers. There is nothing about an entry level IT position, such as a helpdesk position, at most companies which requires a degree. Of course, you will be at an advantage if you do have a degree and apply. The same goes for experience or professional certifications. These things will give you a "leg up" during the hiring process but "requirements" are usually negotiable. If you don&#8217;t have a degree or previous experience it is helpful to have one or more professional certifications though. This is why you are strongly encouraged in your classes to complete professional certifications such as the CompTIA A+ and CCNA. Once you have these certifications you should certainly include them on your resume and applications/interviews.</p>

<h3 id="_what_if_i_dont_have_an_internship_position_when_classes_start_for_the_term_or_i_wont_have_192_hours_done_by_the_end_of_the_term"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_if_i_dont_have_an_internship_position_when_classes_start_for_the_term_or_i_wont_have_192_hours_done_by_the_end_of_the_term"></a>What if I don&#8217;t have an internship position when classes start for the term or I won&#8217;t have 192 hours done by the end of the term?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why we require you have a position and receive approval before you are allowed to register for the internship course. Keep looking for a position. Internships are not like regular classes, we can register you for the internship course at any time during the semester, you do not need to register before the semester starts. As soon as you find and are hired for a position you can contact the ITC internship supervisor to get registered for the class even if it&#8217;s the middle of the semester.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will normally register you for the course during the semester where the majority of your hours will be completed. This may mean that you start working at your internship even before you are registered for the course, that&#8217;s OK as long as you have cleared it with the ITC internship supervisor and have completed all the assignments as described in the <a href="guidelines-policies" class="xref page">Guidelines and Policies</a> and <a href="syllabus" class="xref page">Syllabus</a> portions of the handbook.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you get to the end of a semester which you are registered for the internship course and have been working at an internship but don&#8217;t have all your 192 hours or assignments completed yet you should contact your ITC internship supervisor. Our normal process is for you to request an "Incomplete" grade for the internship course, due to campus policy you must request and agree to the incomplete. You can then finish your hours and/or assignments and work with your ITC internship supervisor to get your final grade submitted and the course completed.</p>

<p>If you are unable to complete the internship within one semester after the semester in which you are registered for the internship you will fail the internship course and need to re-take it to complete the internship requirement.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sorry, no. You must contact the ITC internship supervisor, register for the class, and complete some of the assignments before you can begin counting your hours towards the internship. You then must do other assignments during the course of the 192 hours, and still others after the internship is over. You cannot do these assignments after the fact and need to collaborate with the ITC internship supervisor to get approval for your internship before you can count work towards the internship.</p>

<p>Our goal with the internship course is to launch or propel your career in IT so it is important to get real-world work experience in the IT field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you already work in the IT area (see the Internship Guidelines for details on what constitutes the IT area) it is possible that your existing job may be able to count for the internship. In this case you should read through the requirements in this handbook and then contact the ITC internship supervisor to discuss your situation and request approval to use your current job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do not currently work in the IT field you probably will not be able to count your current job for the internship and will need to find an internship which meets the requirements in this handbook. We do normally require that internships are paid (more information later in this handbook) so the internship course may provide an opportunity to leave your current position and begin your IT career.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, there is much flexibility in the internship program, while many students work 20-40 hours a week during their internship you don&#8217;t have to do this, it&#8217;s possible to complete the internship (over a longer period of time) working 5-10 hours a week if you have another job which you need to keep.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Involvement in a professional field experience has significant value during your academic career. The practical application of classroom learning and practice gives meaning and fulfillment to formal education experienced and the world of full-time professional work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The purpose of this internship experience is to augment formal classroom instruction and to provide you with an opportunity to carry out the concepts discussed during formal classroom instruction. It is a goal of the Inver Hills Community College ITC Internship program to prepare you for the IT workplace by introducing you to an environment where you can exhibit resourcefulness, effectively execute situational leadership, think critically, and use problem-solving to determine solutions to a variety of technology related challenges.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At least once during the course of your internship you will be visited by your supervising faculty member who will meet with your on-site supervisor at the same time at the site of employment. At the discretion of your supervising faculty member a second meeting may be required. Again, at the discretion of the supervising faculty member the first and/or followup meeting(s) may be conducted electronically (via video chat, telephone, etc.) It is generally desirable that at least one meeting must occur at the site of employment and in any event the student must participate from their primary work site unless extraordinary circumstances prevent this. At the end of the internship your on-site supervisor will be asked to complete an evaluation of you and return to your supervising faculty member.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Internships provide an invaluable addition to your curriculum. Not only do they give you an introduction to the world of work, they also enable you to apply specific skills and knowledge acquired in the classroom. This work experience, coupled with the on-site supervisor&#8217;s written evaluation, helps you carefully examine your career options within the information technology field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The internship also provides you with an opportunity to learn new skills, both technical and interpersonal. Hopefully, an additional benefit for many interns will be the chance to create opportunities for future employment.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There must be at least 192 hours of workplace experience for a three credit internship course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may sign up for the internship course on a standard graded course or a pass/fail basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internship grades will, at a minimum, be based on an expectations paper, a work journal, a post-internship report, the meeting(s) with you and your on-site supervisor, and your on-site supervisor&#8217;s written evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except in very specific circumstances the US Department of Labor requires that interns be paid at least minimum wage by employers. Inver Hills Community College will not allow internships which do not meet US Department of Labor criteria. For more information see the US Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #71.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The internship must be in the IT career field. You do not need to work for an IT company, but do need to be working in an Information Technology position. It&#8217;s understood that not all of your work may fall into IT but the majority of your tasks during the 192 hours of the internship should fall into the IT area.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example jobs which typically could be approved for internship credit: helpdesk/service desk, system administrator, network administrator, computer/network security administrator, CIO, managed services technician, computer/network consultant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example jobs which typically would not count for internship credit: data entry, Microsoft Office work (Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Outlook), and work primarily in a computer software application or supporting a computer software application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See also the notes in the ITC Internship Course Enrollment Step #1 below</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact the faculty supervisor with any questions about the suitability of a job as they are the ultimate determinator of whether a job will qualify for internship credit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must be able to work on at least one IT project involving collaboration with others in the IT department, project meetings, change management, etc. In some cases being able to shadow other IT department personnel working on projects may meet this requirement. Contact the instructor for any questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is determined that a job will not qualify for internship credit you may not be permitted to register for the internship course, receive a lower score in the internship course, receive up to one additional semester to find a job which does qualify and complete the coure, or fail the internship course depending on the specific circumstances and when it was discovered that a job will not meet the requirements and why/to what extent the job does not meet the requirements.</p>

Helpdesk work alone is not usually acceptable as an internship, though this can certainly be a large component of it. You are expected to participate in at least one bigger IT project which involves collaboration with others in the IT department, project meetings, change management, etc. or other such experiences above and beyond providing support. These types of opportunities usually exist for internal support but are uncommon in external support. In other words, if you are customer facing instead of employee facing the position may not be a good fit for an internship. <em>If you have specific questions about whether a job would qualify as an internship discuss it with your faculty supervisor prior to signing up for the internship class.</em>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meetings may be held on-site in-person or by Internet video conference at the discretion of your faculty supervisor The meeting(s) must include you, your on-site supervisor, and your supervising faculty member unless your faculty supervisor has specially indicated otherwise. Both your faculty supervisor and your workplace supervisor typically have busy schedules so you should start planning and scheduling this meeting early!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general purpose of these meetings is to review some of the content in your engineering journal, discuss how your internship is going, the technical and non-technical skills you are learning, and assess your growth in the internship process. You must continue making engineering journal or work reflection log entries until all required faculty supervisor meetings are complete and you have permission to move on to your reflection paper. Don&#8217;t forget to make sure a copy of your current engineering journal is submitted to your supervising faculty member about one week before any meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These meetings typically last between 20-30 minutes. About 10-15 minutes will be primarily a discussion between you and the faculty supervisor and about 10-15 minutes will include your on-site supervisor. If the meeting is occurring in person any remaining time is an opportunity to show the faculty supervisor your workplace. If the intern or on site supervisor wishes to have some time alone with the faculty supervisor that can also be accommodated.

<h3 id="_assignments_and_grading"><a class="anchor" href="#_assignments_and_grading"></a>Assignments and Grading</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assignments in this course will consist of a goals and expectations paper, an engineering journal/work reflection log, two faculty supervisor meetings, an end of internship performance review by your employer, and an end of internship paper. A detailed description of these assignments and their requirements can be found in the ITC Internship Student Handbook <a href="guidelines-policies" class="xref page">Guidelines and Policies section</a>. Failure to turn in one or more of these assignments without approval from your instructor may result in an additional lack of participation penalty of up to 20% of your final course grade depending on the type of assignment not completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These assignments will also be used to verify that your internship meets the specific guidelines and requirements for internships in the ITC program as outlined in the ITC Internship Handbook. If your internship fails to meet one or more of the specific guidelines or requirements you should expect a substantially reduced grade on one or more of the assignments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Grades for the course will be computed by weighting these assignments as well as a participation grade based on feedback from your employer and observations by your instructor:</p>

<h4 id="_academic_integrity_plagiarism_and_cheating"><a class="anchor" href="#_academic_integrity_plagiarism_and_cheating"></a>Academic Integrity (Plagiarism and Cheating)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Academic integrity is one of the most important values in higher education. This principle requires that each student&#8217;s work represents his or her own personal efforts and that the student acknowledges the intellectual contributions of others. The foundation for this principle is student academic honesty. IHCC students are expected to honor the requirements of the College Academic Integrity Policy. The following are some examples of unacceptable academic practices that will be viewed as policy violations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the purposes of this policy artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT or automatic summarization systems are "another person". As such they are prohibted unless authorized in advance by your instructor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is unacceptable to submit the work of another person as your own. If you quote, summarize, paraphrase, or use the ideas of another, you must accurately attribute that information. If you do not acknowledge the source, you are plagiarizing. Academic dishonesty also includes unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting the same assignment for multiple classes without instructor permission; taking an examination for another person and many other situations. If you are unsure whether you are plagiarizing or how to cite a source please ask an instructor or staff member for help prior to turning in the assignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this course, the first offense of plagiarism and/or cheating will result in a score of zero on the assignment, quiz or test and reporting of the incident to college administration. Further plagiarism and/or cheating may result in immediate failure of the course and additional consequences determined by college administration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have cheated in other ITC courses that will count as your first offense. In other words, if you have cheated in ITC courses before cheating in this course may result in immediately failing the course and additional consequences determined by college administration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All instances of cheating will be reported to the college administration. In addition, plagiarism and cheating are covered by the Student Code of Conduct. Please see the Catalog or IHCC website for details.</p>

<h4 id="_withdrawing_from_the_course"><a class="anchor" href="#_withdrawing_from_the_course"></a>Withdrawing from the Course</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Students must initiate requests for withdrawal from a course by filing the appropriate form with Enrollment Services. Students who stop attending classes without completing the withdrawal process may receive a grade of “F,” and are responsible for all tuition/fees associated with the course registration. The last day to withdraw from your course will be the date on which 80% of the course has elapsed. The last day to withdraw for each course can be viewed in E-Services by searching for the course at the following link: <a href="https://webproc.mnscu.edu/registration/search/basic.html?campusid=157" class="bare">https://webproc.mnscu.edu/registration/search/basic.html?campusid=157</a>.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recognizing the value and efficiency of communication between faculty/staff and students through electronic mail Inver Hills Community College has designated e-mail as an official mode of communication. At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. Therefore, students are asked to regularly check and utilize the email address they have registered with the college. If your email address has changed it is your responsibility to make sure the college has an up-to date email address where you can be contacted. You should check your email on a regular basis as course changes and communications may be sent by email.</p>

<p>A student may elect to take a course on a pass/fail (P/F) grading basis by contacting the instructor within the first 5 business days of the semester, or within 1 business day of the start date for a course beginning after the first week of the semester. If the instructor approves, they will submit approval to the Enrollment Center. Not all courses are approved for students to elect the P/F grading method and there may be limits to the total number of classes which can be taken pass/fail in your degree or certificate program.
