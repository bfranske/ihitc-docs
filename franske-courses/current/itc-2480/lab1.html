<p>In the lower left corner of the screen, select "Schedule a Lab for Myself". Reservations are used to hold a place on the Netlab system to work on labs during a specific time. All of our lab work in this class is done in a single "Lab Environment" and your progress will be saved from one reservation to another. As a result there is only one lab listed in this course "Linux System Administration Labs". Click on this lab title.</p>

You only need reservations in this class when working with the GUI, which will come later in the class, if you need to turn the power back on to your VM, during the installation process, or if you need local console access to your virtual machine to fix something. The rest of the time you will be able to connect directly to your Linux server using the SSH protocol, but more on that in a bit.

Pay attention to the title of the column at the top, it will say something like "LSA Pod Z".

<p>You will be presented with a summary screen for your reservation where you can set the end time of your reservation (up to a maximum).

<p>Your virtual machines (VMs) will automatically power on when your reservation begins and, because there is no operating system currently installed to their virtual hard drives, they will boot from their virtual CD/DVD drives which have been pre-loaded with the installation ISO DVD image file for Debian Linux.</p>

<p>Once you are in your pod you can either click on the image of the "Linux Server" on the topology diagram or use the tabs across the top of your screen to access the console of your Linux Server VM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The console shows the display of your VM and allows you to type and interact with your VM just as if you were physically sitting down in front of a server with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse attached. Think of a virtual machine console window as a window to a seaparte computer that you are able to see in your web browser. You can see the "virtual monitor" and interact with a keyboard and mouse but just like a separate physical machine you will not be able to copy and paste text or drag and drop files in and out of this console window. We will use other utilities across the network connection to do those things just like we would with a physical server.</p>

There are some things special about physical access to a typical computer compared with network access. THese same things hold true for access to the console of a virtual machine compared with network acces to the virtual machine. In particular, you can observe the full boot process, work with the machine even if the network settings are incorrect or the system is disconnected from a network, and do things like enter "single user mode" or change GRUB boot settings for root account password recovery.

<p>By now your VM has likely already booted from it&#8217;s virtual CD/DVD drive and should be at the "Debian GNU/Linux installer menu". Before continuing let&#8217;s practice rebooting your system so you can watch the system boot and see how to reboot the system if needed. Click the down arrow button on the right side of the "Linux Server" tab at the top of your screen and choose "Power Off" then click the red "Power Off" button on the popup to power off your VM. This is the equivalent of just pulling out the power cord, at least until we install the VMware Tools software which allows for a graceful shutdown, so you&#8217;ll want to be careful to only do this if absolutely needed until then.</p>

We are protected by a firewall which you are getting through by being logged in to NetLab or in the future when you connect by VPN. In a situation where access to a Linux server is directly accessible over the Internet through SSH, SFTP, or similar it is <strong>critical</strong> that all passwords for all system users are strong passwords (or better yet you use SSH keys instead which we&#8217;ll discuss in a future lab). Bad actors on the Internet are constantly scanning for systems they can try and access using password dictionaries and other attacks. If you use a simple password or have otherwise bad security on your system it will get compromised quite quickly.

If you forget your password it is possible to recover them because we have local console access to the system but that is not something covered in this course so you are on your own if that happens. The official method to get back into your system as far as this course is concerned is to format and reset your virtual machine and start over with a fresh installation. If you want to avoid this major annoyance it is very important that you do not forget or loose your passwords.

<p>For security purposes it is usually the case that you do not want to log in as the root user.

<p>A good practice is to update your system package lists before installing any new packages. Because we are logged in as the <em>root</em> (main administrative) user we can just type <code>apt update</code> and press enter to do this. The output from this command will look something like:</p>

As mentioned earlier to keep things secure while you learn to setup a Linux server your Linux server is not directly accessible from the Internet. This means there is an extra step of connecting to the ITCnet Student VPN before attempting to access any devices on the 172.17.50.0/23 network (where your Linux server is). The only time this is not required is if your administration PC is already on the ITCnet network. For example you do not need to connect to the VPN if you are completing the lab from one of the ITC labs on campus and the computer you are using is plugged into an ITCnet connection or you are using the Windows administation PC as a virtual machine through Netlab. If one of these situations does not apply (such as if you are connecting directly from your home computer or from a laptop on the campus WiFi) you will need to connect to the VPN before opening an SSH session so that your system is on ITCnet.

In some areas people have been legally charged and prosecuted for scanning of systems which they are not authorized to do. You have been warned! In our case this should not be an issue because you will be scanning your own system and other systems which have specifically been allowed for this use.

<p>Although Debian does have version numbers it&#8217;s more common that people will refer to each version by the codename. Different codenames have different versions of software available, different instructions for making changes to settings on the system, and different packages installed by default so it can be important to know what codename you are running when following instructions from the Internet or asking for help with an issue.</p>

<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Use the <code>uname -a</code> command to find the kernel release and version numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The kernel is the heart of the operating system, in fact as your readings have described it really is the "Linux" in the "GNU/Linux" operating system. Different releases of the kernel have different features available, especially as it relates to filesystems, hardware support, and driver compatibility. As a result it can be important to know the release the kernel running on your system is based on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each distribution of Debian that builds (also known as compiles) it&#8217;s own specific version of the kernel also assigns it a version number as various settings and features can also be enabled or disabled during the build process (this is why it is sometimes neccecary to build your own custom version of the kernel). So when checking for information about what might be included in the specific version of the kernel installed on your system it is also important to know what the version number assigned by the person who built the kernel is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, every version of the kernel is built to target a certain processor or hardware architecture (i386, i686, amd64, arm, armhf, mips, m68k, sparc64, powerpc, etc.) and the kernel needs to match the hardware in the system to achieve the best performance (such as a 64 bit kernel on a 64 bit CPU) so it can also be important to check the architcture the kernel was built for.</p>

<p>Example output:</p>
<div class="listingblock">

<p>Check how long your system has been running</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Use the <code>uptime</code> command to find out how long your system has been running, how many users are currently logged on, and the system load averages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This command will print a line like:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-none hljs">ben@2480-Z:~$ uptime
 15:35:42 up  1:43,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case the "15:35:42" is the current time, the "1:43" means the system has been running for 1 hour and 43 minutes, there are two users currently logged on to the server, and the system load average for the past 1, 5 and 15 minutes have all been nearly zero.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In another example you may see a line like:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-none hljs">ben@files:~$ uptime
 20:38:03 up 177 days,  2:19,  1 user,  load average: 0.50, 0.46, 0.42</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case the "20:38:03" is the current time, the "177 days, 2:19" means the system has been running for 177 days 2 hours and 19 minutes, there is one user currently logged on to the server, and the system load average for the past 1 minute was 0.50, 5 minutes was 0.46, and 15 minutes was 0.42</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>As stated in the manual for the <code>uptime</code> command:</p>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>System load averages is the average number of processes that are either in a runnable or uninterruptable state. A process in a runnable state is either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU. A process in uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for disk. The averages are taken over the three time intervals.  Load averages are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so a load average of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75% of the time.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Effectively this means if you divide the load average by the number of cores in your system you get roughly the percentage of CPU utilization on the system (in decimal format so multiply that by 100). In the example above with a one minute load average of 0.50 this means if this was a single core system over the past minute the CPU was about 50% utilized. If this was a dual core system the CPU was about 25% utilized (0.50/2*100=25) and if it was a quad core system it was about 12.5% utilized (0.50/4*100=12.5).</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will normally leave our Linux server VM running but it is important that you know how to shutdown a Linux system correctly so just this time we&#8217;ll turn it off. Failure to safely shut down a Linux system can cause the same types of issues that it can with any other system, most notably filesystem corruption if the power is just suddenly cut off to the system. Note that in a virtual machine environment the power doesn&#8217;t literally have to go off for this to happen, if the if the virtual machine is "powered off" by Netlab or VMware and the open-vm-tools are not installed or if the virtual machine is force powered off by Netlab or VMware it has the same effect as pulling out the power cable on a physical system.</p>

<p>Open a SSH session to your Linux server using your standard user account</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">

<p>Safely shutdown you server</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Run the <code>sudo shutdown -h now</code> command to safely shutdown the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that it takes a little time for your system to go through the shutdown process during which you will get disconnected from the SSH session but if you have a local console window open on Netlab you will see shutdown messages on the display of your Linux server before it finally powers off.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using the Administrative PC in Netlab instead of your own computer as the administrative computer you should also shut down that system in the usual way each time you are done with the Netlab system. You should do this each time you finish using the adminsitrative PC in future labs as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End your Netlab Reservation</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>If you still have time left in your reservation in Netlab it&#8217;s polite to end the reservation so other users can work on the system, only a limited number of reservations can be made at one time. You can do this by logging into Netlab, opening your lab, and clicking the "Reservation" menu at the top of the screen and choose to "End Reservation Now" followed by confirming that you want to end the reservation.</p>
